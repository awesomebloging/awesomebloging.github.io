You need to choose one of them to start mining.   The first option is --algo (-a) followed by one of the following algorithm names:                  BEAM-I       BeamHash I                 BEAM-II       BeamHash II                 BEAM-III       BeamHash III                 C29D       CuckarooD 29                 C29Z       CuckarooZ 29                 C30CTX       Cuckaroo 30 Cortex                 C31       Cuckatoo 31                 C32       Cuckatoo 32                 EQUI144_5       Equihash 144/5                 EQUI192_7       Equihash 192/7                 EQUI210_9       Equihash 210/9                 ZEL       ZelHash           Note that you can always find out the supported algorithms with the command: lolMiner –list-algos. The size of the commission will also be shown. This list will inform you if the program supports the algorithm / requires the personalization parameter (--pers), which is needed for some Equihash-based algorithms.   The second way to configure lolMiner is through the --coin (-c)  parameter. This option sets more detailed settings for the selected profiles and allows you to use special features such as algorithm switches or a combination of an algorithm with the correct personalization.   You can check the detailed list of additional parameters for lolMiner using the lolMiner -h command.

This is necessary to increase the performance of a gpu in mining and not only.   Variety of cards are supported: from and to RX580.   The main features of SRBPolaris are:     unlocking the backup shaders;   Copy memory straps fast and easy   copying / editing time periods of work,   Memory timing strap editor - make your own custom straps   Unlock RX460 additional shaders   Set GPU voltage   Set default GPU and MEM clocks   Lot’s of useful stuff   This program is considered convenient, easy to use, and, importantly, it is more suitable for beginners or those who are busy with other things, and who has no time to delve deeply into something and study.   Acceleration of the video card is achieved by changing the initial settings in the BIOS of the video card, which are used by the operating system and application programs that are read during the initialization of the equipment immediately after turning on the computer.   The firmware of video cards for mining gives a significant increase in performance, for example, the flashed RX 570 gives out 30-40% higher speed when mining, in contrast to the non-flashed version. Bypassing the firmware of video cards, you will most likely need to improve the drivers of the operating system.   After flashing, it is extremely simple and convenient to monitor and control the characteristics of the video card using the GPU-Z and HWinfo programs, the main task of which is to demonstrate the voltage, frequencies, load on the video card and many other information that will be extremely useful.   Overclocking can be easily checked in HWinfo by monitoring video memory errors. With a large number of these errors, it is necessary to reduce overclocking by decreasing the operating frequency of the video memory or flashing less aggressive timings.   SRBPolaris Won’t Start?   The program requires .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)   Install it:        You will see the Windows Installer:        You need to wait about 5-10 minutes.

        "excerpt":"               Everything about TeamRedMiner: Setup for ETH, Binance pool, Fee and more.          In this guide, you will learn how to set up and use the TimRedMiner 0.8.4 and newer software for mining cryptocurrencies.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download releases from GitHub   Download releases from BitcoinTalk       TeamRedMiner review     TeamRedMiner is an AMD-exclusive mining software developed by programmers Todxx and Kerney666.     This software can mine cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ravencoin, Grin, Zcoin and others.     It is a command line program. This means that you run it from either the Windows command line or the Linux console, or you create shortcuts to predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or Windows command (.bat) file.      How to set up TeamRedMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t \t\t \t\tFirst, you need to download the software from this GitHub Release link. Make sure you select the correct file for your OS. If you have Linux, download the .tar.gz file, if you have Windows, download the .zip file. \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure a batch file for Ethereum  \t\t \t\t \t\tYou need to choose the correct config file (batch file) depending on the algorithm that you want to use for mining. For example binance pool .bat file will look like this: \t\t\t \t\t\tteamredminer.exe -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -u username1.worker_name -p x \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Stat TimRedMiner  \t \t \t \tEdit this file (replace the account name username1 with your account name). You can also change the mining URL, i.e. choose another pool. Then save as a batch file - .bat- if you are on Windows or as a bash file - .sh- if you are on Linux \t  \t \t  \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Team Red Miner Ethereum Setup      stratum stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org   PORT: 4444   Username: Wallet address   Password: Worker Password     To set up a batch file for ETH and etheremine pool, we need to enter 6 commands one by one:           teamredminer.exe - the name of the program to start. Please note that the batch file itself must be in the same folder as the program itself   -a ethash - after the key -a we indicate the algorithm for mining. In this example, Ether is therefore specifieded ethash   -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org - we indicate the address of the pool. This example uses ethermine.   :4444 - after the colon, we indicate the port of the pool. Ethermine has 4444.   -u 0x0c19EfE277b4e64f26c93b3a48A26EeD310421c8 - after that -u we write the address of our wallet to which mining will go.   .trmtest - we indicate the name of the worker after the dot. You can specify any. It is needed for the name of the farm, when you will be tracking statistics on the pool.   This is how the TeamRedMiner batch file for ETH on the ethermine pool will look:   teamredminer.exe -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x0c19EfE277b4e64f26c93b3a48A26EeD310421c8.trmtest -p x   NiceHash Config   Here is a batch file for NiceHesh:   teamredminer.exe -a kawpow -o stratum+tcp://kawpow.eu.nicehash.com:3385 -u 3LZhp4g3m7YWqR4hAPrZsKWbyo7hRBmqvy.trmtest -p x        This is an example for RVN:           kawpow - indicate the mining algorithm. In this case, Ravencoin   kawpow.eu-west.nicehash.com - specify the pool server for nicehash   3385 - we write the port from the pool   3LZhp4g3m7YWqR4hAPrZsKWbyo7hRBmqvy - and a wallet. Important! To mine for nice hash, you need to specify your BTC wallet, and not the coin you are mining.

In this guide, you will learn how to set up and use the T-Rex miner mining software to mine Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download releases from GitHub   Download from the website   Download releases from BitcoinTalk       T Rex Miner review     T-Rex Miner - is a multi-algorithm mining software optimized for NVIDIA graphics cards. This mining software can mine cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin and others.     Miner T-Rex is a command line program. This means that you run it either from the Windows command line, or from the Linux console, or create shortcuts to predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or a Windows batch file.      How to Install T-Rex Miner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t \t\t \t\tFirst, you need to download the software from this link. Make sure you select the correct file for your OS. If you are on Windows, download the .zip file. If on Linux, select the .tar.gz file. From the names of the files, you can see that these are versions of the program for different versions of the CUDA driver for your video card.  \t\t   If in doubt, download everything. \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure a batch file for Ethereum  \t\t \t\t \t\tOnce you download the program, you need to select the correct script file depending on the algorithm you want to use to mine cryptocurrency. Then edit the mining bat file and fill it with the wallet address, worker (farm) name and mining pool URL. Then save it as a .bat file if you are on Windows or bash - .sh if you are on Linux.

To set up a batch file for solo mining, we need to run the wallet in server mode with port 9999 and enter other commands:   cpuminer-sse2.exe -a scrypt -o http://127.0.0.1:9999 --coinbase-addr DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo  pause   Here we added --coinbase-addr  - used for solo mining.   You can try adding the rpc resolving IP to create .conf file To allow connections only from your local network, you can specify your subnet in the rpcconnect parameter.

If you have upgraded the Google Chrome browser to version 91, you may have noticed that some file downloads don’t work anymore in the browser.   But first, here’s a brief explanation of why this happens, assuming you know the file you’re trying to download is safe. Google Chrome and other web browsers will try and identify possibly malicious files. One minor flaw in this concept is that most web browsers often will flag unknown files as malicious. This is commonly known as heuristics, which is a fancy word for guessing.   But here comes a problem, files considered as unsafe by Chrome might however be “clean.” It can be frustrating when Chrome keeps blocking a download that you know it is from a trusted source.

Ethereum Mining How to create your Ethminer Batch File &amp; Config Setup          subscribe   To increase performance, use the cl-local-work setting in Ethminer NVidia. Set the value to 128 if, in addition to mining on devices, you perform additional work, or 256 if you have a mining farm. The cl-global-work command is used with the default parameter 8192. It is possible to increase the metric by 2 or 4 times to increase the impact.   Applying these settings will increase the mining power by a couple of megahashes. Make sure you have a good cooling system when using, as the GPUs will run at higher operating temperatures. Transfer the batch file to the basic settings, or the hash began to sag or the cards overheat.   Frequent problems   As with other software, miners give errors. Rarely are they critical. Here are the most common ones:           Ethminer no openCl platform found - the error appears if you use graphics processors from NVidia. Here, use the –u command to enable CUDA technology.

PolarisBiosEditor Pro is compatible with almost 99% of video cards with this architecture. PBE is suitable for RX4x0 and RX5x0 video adapters. Works with video cards with 2-8 GB and 16 GB memory.     Polaris Bios Editor PRO 3 2020 - is a paid version of Polaris Bios Editor. This version gives the largest increase in hash rate compared to the standard one, however, for 100% performance, you still need to manually adjust the memory clock frequencies and core voltages, the editor cannot predict the quality of the video card, so it is impossible to automatically use the maximum values.      The program supports the following memory: Elpida, micron, samsung, hynix.      How to use PolarisBiosEditor  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the program  \t\t \t\t \t\tFirst of all, go to the official website.

Click OK.       We recommend that you test the new timings first. Take some time and watch the performance. If it is lower than expected, then reboot the BIOS. However, if you are asked about the timing again, refuse by pressing the \"NO\" button. Then a different timing will be applied.   After successfully applying the timings, you will see the following window:         \t\t \t\t \t   \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Save BIOS  \t \t \t \tAfter completing these procedures, you can save the modified BIOS file. However, save as a new document. Otherwise, the original BIOS will be overwritten. We recommend that you always have it in stock.

In 2018, he released his own wallet, calling it a direct competitor to MyEtherWallet. In fact, it is a fork, and therefore the interface will be familiar to many. For the exchange of cryptocurrencies, a special service is involved here, implemented directly into the program. The application runs on a PC.

The money will come in a few hours, depending on the network congestion.   You can also use money from a bank card. To do this, in the exchanger, select the appropriate method, specify the required data. Please note that the commission for carrying out the operation for different methods is different. Somewhere it will be cheaper, and somewhere more expensive.   How do I fund ETC?   The cryptocurrency wallet works not only with the blockchain itself, but also directly with the Ethereum Classic network. So you can send or receive ETC. To switch to Ethereum Classic, you need:      Go to the site.   Select the ETC network at the top of the page.      The address for ETC will be identical to ETH. However, the balances will be different. Over time, you will get used to doing this kind of login. Note that it is best to use a hardware wallet in conjunction with MyEtherWallet. This is much safer, since the site is faked once or twice by scammers.   An online wallet is not a place for storing cryptocurrency. It only provides a graphical shell so that it is convenient to work with the network. To do this, he creates a private key, to which a public key is issued in a pair. It is also called the address or wallet number for convenience.   It is important to understand that only you should have the private key. Do not pass it on to third parties as it provides access to your cryptocurrency wallet. A public address is used to receive and transfer tokens. Press the button next to the number 1.        A window will open:      with your public address, which can be shown to everyone (“My wallet address”)   and a private key (“My private key”) which cannot be shown to anyone.        How to download the offline version to a computer?   You can download the desktop version from the GitHub repository. To do this, go to the releases of the repository and scroll down to “Assets”. Here you will see the file MyEtherWallet.zip.

And so, you have an offline version of the wallet on your PC.   Gas limit   Please note that gas is charged as a commission on air. What is a gas limit? This is the maximum amount of gas that is spent to confirm the transaction. The standard cost is 21,000. However, if desired, the commission can be changed in the settings.           Go to the “Send Transaction” tab.   Find the “Gas Limit &amp; Data” switch.   Indicate the gas limit that you need.   How to withdraw Ether   How to withdraw money? The procedure is also quite simple. True, for this you need to have tokens on your account. You can send digital coins as follows:           Select a token in the “Send Transaction” tab.   Enter the amount to send (number of coins).   Enter the recipient’s address.   Check the details and click Next. Check the details again and confirm that you are confident in the operation.   How to check an account or transaction?   You don’t need to be constantly logged into MyEtherWallet to check your balance. Moreover, there are a bunch of services that display data on all transactions carried out on the network.   It is enough to go to the blockchain explorer, enter the wallet address and see at what stage the operation is.

Download for Windows / Linux        Download from site   Download releases   Download from BitcoinTalk       What is CGMiner?     CGMiner - is an open source miner for ASIC, GPU and FPGA. It works on Windows, Linux and macOS. CGMiner is extremely flexible in terms of platform and can work with a variety of hardware miners and GPUs including AMD, CUDA and NVIDIA platforms.     Supported algorithms     The program supports the following algorithms:          Scrypt     SHA-256     NeoScrypt     CryptoNight       While developing the program, programmers focused on the performance of their software. Therefore, it is not the most convenient to use. In fact, the console is used for management with the introduction of certain commands, but there is no graphical shell. As a result, it can be difficult for beginners to operate this software.          How to use CGMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the program  \t\t There are two options to download the program:  Official website of the developer..  On the GitHub site.     On the official website you will find a complete instruction with a description of all the commands of the program. The address of the official page on GitHub  is here. This way you can be sure that the program is safe and free of malware. Do not use third-party sources - you can lose access to data and your tokens.       \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tШаг 2 - Set up the program  \t\t \t\t Settings are entered through the console. We recommend using a batch file (a text file with an extension .bat) for more convenience. In it, you can save all the necessary data so that you do not enter them when you restart the program again. Using the coinfoundry example, the batch file will look like this:  setx GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 0 setx GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE 100 setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1 setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 setx GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 cgminer --scrypt -I 10 -o stratum+tcp://pool.coinfoundry.org:3151 -u DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo.my_worker_password -p my_worker_password -T  pause  Enter instead DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo your Dogecoin wallet address.   \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Start the miner  \t The miner is launched by double-clicking on the file with the extension .bat.

The main .bat file setting has the following data:   Cgminer –scrypt –o stratum+tcp\\\\:pool_address:port –u wallet.1 – p x   Here:      Cgminer –shows the file used to run the miner.   -scrypt – an indication of the algorithm used to obtain the digital token that the miner should use.   -o – after it you need to specify the address of the pool with the port. Take them in the pool where you are going to mine. You can find it in the “Getting Started” category.   -u user – displaying the login that was used when registering on the pool, here enter the name of the worker, which was made there.   -p x – enter the password that was used to create the worker.   This completes the configuration of the bat file.   Example for dogecoin   setx GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 0 setx GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE 100 setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1 setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 setx GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 cgminer --scrypt -I 10 -o stratum+tcp://stratum.aikapool.com:7915 -u my_worker_name.my_worker_password -p my_worker_password -T  pause   Commands   To get a fine configuration, you need to use a number of special commands:   -auto-fan – adjusting the speed of the GPU cooler to maintain a certain temperature. Sets the metric automatically.   -auto–gpu – sets the GPU frequency to maintain a certain temperature. Works automatically.   -device (-d) – defines a specific video card. By default, the program launches everything it detects. The value of the card is placed next to it (for example, -device 1).   Disable GPU   -disable-gpu (-G) - disabling graphics processors.        -gpu-threads (-g) - setting the amount of threads on the graphics processor. The indicator is set from 1 to 10. By default, the program sets 2. The value is placed next to the command - -gpu-thread.   -gpu-dyinterval - setting the refresh period in milliseconds for video adapters using dynamic intensity. Standard cost -gpu-dyinterval.   -gpu-engine-  setting the frequency indicator for the video adapter. It is permissible to enter both one indicator and a whole range. It looks like this: -gpu-engine 700 or 700-900.   -gpu-fan - setting the fan speed in percentage, a certain value or range. It looks like this: -gpu-fan 50 or 50-65.   -gpu-map - matches OpenCl with ADL hardware number manually or paired CSV. For example, 1: 0.2: 1 shows OpenCl 1 over ADL 0.2 over 1.   -gpu-memlock - setting the memory frequency. In the case of bitcoin mining, we recommend lowering it, for litecoin - raising it. Looks like that: -gpu-memlock   -gpu-memdiff - sets the specific difference between kernel and memory. The indicator is entered in megahertz. It looks like this: -gpu-memdiff ???.   -gpu-powertune - GPU powertune installation. The value is selected in%.   -gpu-reorder - re-sorting video cards.   -Gpu-vddc - change the voltage on the core. The data is entered in this form: -gpu-vddc125.   -intensity (–I) - sets the intensity. The range of selectable indicators is from one to 14. Setting the value “d” - indicates that the indicator is dynamic. It looks like this: -intensity 10 or d.   -kernel (-k) - specifying the kernel for the hardware. It can be diablo, poclbm, phatk, diakgcn. It looks like this: -kernel diakgcn - help is needed in choosing kernels for GPUs.   -ndevs (-n`) - displays a list of graphics processors, number and outputs.   -temp-hysteresis - the temperature difference in ℃ from the expected indicator is indicated. The standard cost is 3. It looks like this:-temp-hysteresis   -temp-overheat - temperature, specified in ℃, when dropping core frequencies. This is where the coolers work faster (rpm increase). Fitted as standard 85. It looks for example like this: -temp-overheat 95.   -temp-target - the desired temperature is set. The value is in degrees. Standard costs 75. It looks like this: -temp-target 90.   -vectors (-v) - sets the width of vectors. By default, the indicator is selected automatically, but you can specify your own: 1, 2 or 4. Here it is indicated as follows: -vectors   -worksize(-w) - the size of the memory is set. However, it has virtually no effect on performance. Automatic selection of the indicator is standard. When self-introduction, select it in multiples of 64: 64, 128, etc. Recommended 256. Looks like this: -worksize   How to set up in windows 10?    setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 2 cgminr.exe –srypt –worsize 512 –intensity 10 –auto-fan –lookup-gap 4 –thread-concurrency 25614 – gpu-engine 1050 –gpu-memlock 1500 –gpu-powertune 15 –o stratum+tcp: east1.us.stratum.dedicatedpool.com:3352 u worker -p XXX   where XXX is the worker password.   Please note that the miner is also compatible with Linux and OSX. In the case of Linux, you can also enable remote access. However, it will not be possible to configure the operation of the video adapter as efficiently as on Windows.          How to Setup CGMiner to Mine Cryptocurrencys (Litecoin &amp; Dogecoin)      subscribe   Review   The program is aimed exclusively at experienced users who are mining cryptocurrencies. Consequently, the functionality is versatile. The software was launched back in 2011. Since then, it has only improved and increased its positive qualities. The launch was made with open source code, which allows you to be confident in the reliability of the software.   The main developer was Kon Kolivas. He is also known for contributing to the development of Linux. At the same time, he is an anesthesiologist by profession, developing programs for him is a simple hobby.   The program is recognized as the most effective software for the extraction of electronic tokens using AMD and NVidia video adapters.   The software allows you to improve the performance of video adapters, making it possible to fine-tune graphics devices.        Most of the known digital coins can be mined on these algorithms. It is used in the mining of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Monero, Litecoin and other well-known digital tokens. Provides a number of benefits:      Allows you to overclock GPUs, providing excellent functionality.   You can adjust the rotational speed of the coolers used in cooling systems.   The algorithms used provide the most efficient cryptocurrency mining.   You can enable automatic switching between workers.   Work with the use of proxy servers is available.   There is no commission for using the program. Hence, it is 100% free.   There is a balancing of the algorithm.   If the workers are not working, the program will disable them.   Key features   The official site allows you to download the software for free. However, please note that the latest versions of the program focused exclusively on ASICs and FPGAs, since the developers decided not to continue to support mining on CPUs and video processors. It is worth using old software releases for them. These include versions prior to 3.7.8.   Basically, it is worth working on AMD, since the software does not work well with CUDA. For NVidia, it is better to choose another miner, for example, Claymore.   The program has several interesting points. One of them is the introduction of tools to overclock GPUs and set the desired fan speed in the cooling system. True, it is worth using this functionality carefully, since there is a high chance of spoiling the equipment and sending it to the scrap.   The program also provides configuration information, automatically turns off the worker, causing problems or simply not working. You can use proxy, balance loading strategy and Round Robin. Thanks to this, miners can independently enter the parameters of the width of the vectors, the waiting time for the connection restoration, create a specified delay for the router and configure a separate display of notifications. The work of the program is configured through a special configuration file.   Conclusions   There are a huge number of cryptocurrency programs that help set up equipment for mining digital tokens. They are called miners - this is special software that allows you to make the equipment work as efficiently as possible. However, not all of them are successful, some have poor functionality, others have a complex interface. Cgminer is one of the few programs that has proven its effectiveness empirically. It is used by a huge number of miners around the world.   ","categories": ["miners"],

She reports problems. If you need to patch the video card driver, then you need to use the Atikmdag patcher. Then follow the simple steps:      Download the program and unzip it.   Run as administrator.   In the window that appears, click “yes”.   After completing the operation, confirm the action. Next, you need to reboot the system. If the message with Code 43 does not appear, then the problem is closed. Otherwise, you need to reinstall the driver or the operating system itself. We also recommend checking the equipment itself. When mining, it overheats or the riser has problems.          Video: How to Fix AMD Radeon Graphics Error 43 on Windows 10     subscribe   How to restore an old driver version   To restore an unpatched driver, run the patcher again and click “Yes” to restore from a backup.   After completing the procedure, you can install a more frequent update using the program to customize the video card in more detail.   Review   The program is compatible with Catalyst 15.12 - Crimson 18.2.3 driver. It can be used in future versions if it finds the settings you want.   Requirements  The patcher doesn’t require much. It is suitable for Windows starting from the Vista series and all subsequent versions, up to the latest “ten”. Graphics editor from AMD / ATI should be 5000 series and newer.   With R9 cards from 285 to 295X2, it becomes possible to better handle frequencies with an increased resolution without using CrossFire.   Compatibility  Each version is capable of working with a specific driver package, like this:      4.7 will fit the series up to 20.5.1.   4.8 is coming up to 20.5.1 and newer.   4.9 will approach Catalist 11.9 and Adrenaline 20.12.2.   The program is not working? Solutions   If Atikmdag patcher does not start, then remove the patcher and download again. The file may have been corrupted during the download. Download only from trusted sources.   Atikmdag sys: blue screen of death          Video: Fix system thread exception not handled     subscribe   Quite often, an error is displayed on a blue screen Atikmdag sysas a result of incorrect installation of drivers. Its damage is also often to blame. The problem occurs on AMD and ATI Radeon graphics cards. Most often, it is enough to reinstall the drivers or update them to get rid of the problem. However, this does not always help.   Code 0x0000003  This code indicates a completely different problem. Most likely there was a conflict when working with the video driver Win32K. The problem is not difficult to fix. Just download the correct version of the patch. When installing the video driver, be sure to run the program update to automatic mode.   File replacement   When a new version of the program is launched, the old file is sent to System32\\drivers. The result is the use of the operating system of the old program. Windows does not use the new one. The result is a blue screen of death (BSOD).          Video: Blue screen error atikmpag.sys/atikmdag.sys Complete FIX     subscribe   To get rid of the problem, you need to replace the file, following the instructions:      Head to the operating system section. This location is often the hard drive “C”.   Navigate to the folder address System32\\drivers.   Find atikmdag.   Give it an extension .sys.old.   Go to your hard drive C.   Open the folder ATI.   Find sys.   Transfer to your desktop.   Open a command prompt via start.   Enter chdir Desktop, confirm your entry.   Enter the command Expand.exe atikmdag.sy_ atikmdag.sy   Copy the new file on your desktop and send it to your drivers folder.   Reboot your system.   As a result of these actions, the problem should be completely eliminated. If this did not happen, the update of the video drivers did not help, we recommend that you check the hardware itself.   Version history   1.4.9 Version 1.4.9 is new. It can work with Catalyst 11.9 as well as Adrenalin 20.12.2. It will also work for the following GPU models if it can find the limitations you need.   1.4.8 The program will be able to work with video drivers from 20.5.1, where the file has already been named amdkmdag.sys. It will ensure it works properly. There should be no errors in use.   1.4.7 Can be used when installing drivers not higher than version 20.5.1. Also capable of supporting SL-DVI / HDMI limitation.

        "excerpt":"               OhGodAnETHlargementPill: Download from official site, GitHub (for windows 10 and linux).          In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up and use OhGodAnETHlargementPill r2, r3 and newer.   Download for Windows/Linux        Download from GitHub   Download from GitHub (R2)       What is OhGodAnETHlargementPill     OhGodAnETHlargementPill - is a mining pill designed for users of Nvidia graphics cards based on GDDR5X video memory (GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti). It significantly increases the hash rate when mining cryptocurrencies using the Ethash algorithm (Dagger Hashimoto). The program is available for both Linux and Windows.     ETHlargementPill was released for GDDR5X memory only. All you need to do to increase the hashrate of Ethereum (ETH) or another Ethash based cryptocurrency to 50 MH/S on a GTX 1080 Ti (up to 40 MH/s on a GTX 1080) is to run it along with your miner.      Relevance and alternatives   NiceHash QuickMiner already includes the same functionality and is 100% safe to use. Use QuickMiner instead.   In 2021, OhGodAnETHlargementPill is no longer needed if you are using PhoenixMiner. You should use the command -straps 2 for the same effect.   In another mining program - NBMiner, use the command -mt. It does the same thing as a pill. This setting is enabled when mining on 1080 and 1080ti GPUs.   If you still need a “tablet”, then it comes with the NiceHash client.   If you nevertheless decide to use this software separately.    How to use OhGodAnETHlargementPill  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the program  \t\t \t\t \t\tDownload the file. Or download from release R2/R3. \t\t   \t\t  \t\t \t  \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Run the program  \t\t \t\t \t\t Leave the program window open and start setting up mining for maximum profit. I had to raise PL from standard settings from 55 to 80, and the memory frequency was increased by 50 MHz.      \t\t \t\t \t   \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Leave the Program Running  \t \t \t After completing these procedures, you will see an increase in the hash rate on video cards with GDDR5X memory.    \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo Tutorial  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     For Minerstat users   Disable ETHPill by this command mpill and instead use the \"mt\": 1-6 argument in the advanced trex client setup.   For example:   all gpus:  \"mt\": 4,  or a specific gpu`s by  \"mt\": \"4,0,4\" ,          Video: GTX 1080 Mining ETH Hash Rate almost 40MH/S without pill + settings      subscribe   Does not work?   Run --revA Command with the Tool.   Some GTX 1080s don’t run well with the default tool, so they could attempt to use this command. This is also found on the ethlargement’s prescription:   Windows: OhGodAnETHlargementPill.exe --revA 0,3,4   Powershell: .\\OhGodAnETHlargementPill.exe --revA 0,3,4   Linux: ./OhGodAnETHlargementPill --revA 0,3,4   You may have noticed the numbers after --revA. These values are the gpu slots, and they are a requirement to run the program properly. For instance, if your mining rig is composed solely of GTX 1080s and you have 3 cards, it would be --revA 0,1,2.   Also, if you’re wondering how to do this for Windows, you have to use the command line and change directories or folders into the exact location of the ethlargement program before copy and pasting that command in. To know it works, it should pop up the program.   Note! Some GPUs will perform better if you run Ethlargement after your mining program start hashing away.   What GPUs does the tablet work for?   As mentioned above, the tablet only works with GDDR5X memory. Find this memory in the table and you will see the model of the video card.    \t \t\t \t\t \t \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGPU Model \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMemory \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 3090 \t\t\t24GB GDDR6X \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti \t\t\t12GB GDDR6X \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT \t\t\t16GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT \t\t\t16GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 \t\t\t10GB GDDR6X \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 6800 \t\t\t16GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti \t\t\t8GB GDDR6X \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia Titan RTX \t\t\t24GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti \t\t\t11GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 \t\t\t8GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT \t\t\t12GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti \t\t\t8GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia Titan V \t\t\t12GB HBM2 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super \t\t\t8GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 2080 \t\t\t8GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia Titan Xp \t\t\t12GB GDDR5X \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super \t\t\t8GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon VII \t\t\t16GB HBM2 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti \t\t\t11GB GDDR5X \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 5700 XT \t\t\t8GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 12GB \t\t\t12GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 2070 \t\t\t8GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 5700 \t\t\t8GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super \t\t\t8GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX Vega 64 \t\t\t8GB HBM2 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 5600 XT \t\t\t6GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1080 \t\t\t8GB GDDR5X \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce RTX 2060 \t\t\t6GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX Vega 56 \t\t\t8GB HBM2 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1070 Ti \t\t\t8GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super \t\t\t6GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti \t\t\t6GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1070 \t\t\t8GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GTX Titan X (Maxwell) \t\t\t12GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 980 Ti \t\t\t6GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1660 \t\t\t6GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon R9 Fury X \t\t\t4GB HBM \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 590 \t\t\t8GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 5500 XT 8GB \t\t\t8GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 580 8GB \t\t\t8GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Super \t\t\t4GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 5500 XT 4GB \t\t\t4GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon R9 390 \t\t\t8GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB \t\t\t6GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 980 \t\t\t4GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 570 4GB \t\t\t4GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GTX 1650 GDDR6 \t\t\t4GB GDDR6 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3GB \t\t\t3GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 970 \t\t\t4GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1650 \t\t\t4GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti \t\t\t4GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 560 4GB \t\t\t4GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GTX 1050 \t\t\t2GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Radeon RX 550 \t\t\t4GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tNvidia GeForce GT 1030 \t\t\t2GB GDDR5 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Vega 11 (R5 3400G) \t\t\t2x8GB DDR4-3200 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAMD Vega 8 (R3 3200G) \t\t\t2x8GB DDR4-3200 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tIntel Iris Plus (i7-1065G7) \t\t\t2x8GB LPDDR4X-3733 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tIntel UHD Graphics 630 (i7-10700K) \t\t\t2x8GB DDR4-3200 \t\t \t          Video: OhGodAnETHlargementPill 55MH/s on 1080ti, overview and results, OhGodACompany Tool      subscribe   Increase the mining power of your nvidia gtx 1080 ti and gtx 1080   Overclock parameters:   Settings for my 8 GPUs, the fifth being a GPU a GTX 1080 and the others GTX 1080Ti:   Core Clock: 100 Memory Clock: 950 950 950 950 800 950 950 950 Fan Speed: 90 90 90 90 95 90 90 90 90 Power Limit: 200 200 200 200 150 200 200 200   See below the ideal clock setting for several models of boards with NVIDIA chip:   GTX 1060, 1070, 1080 1080Ti Core Clock = 100  Memory Clock GTX 1060 = 700 GTX 1070 = 900 GTX 1080 = 925 GTX 1080Ti = 950  GTX 1060, 1070, 1080 1080Ti Fan % 75%  Power Limit GTX 1060 = 75 GTX 1070 = 100 GTX 1080 = 150 GTX 1080Ti = 200          Video: Hive os overclock + ohgodanethlargementpill      subscribe   ","categories": ["tools"],
