You need to choose one of them to start mining.   The first option is --algo (-a) followed by one of the following algorithm names:                  BEAM-I       BeamHash I                 BEAM-II       BeamHash II                 BEAM-III       BeamHash III                 C29D       CuckarooD 29                 C29Z       CuckarooZ 29                 C30CTX       Cuckaroo 30 Cortex                 C31       Cuckatoo 31                 C32       Cuckatoo 32                 EQUI144_5       Equihash 144/5                 EQUI192_7       Equihash 192/7                 EQUI210_9       Equihash 210/9                 ZEL       ZelHash           Note that you can always find out the supported algorithms with the command: lolMiner –list-algos. The size of the commission will also be shown. This list will inform you if the program supports the algorithm / requires the personalization parameter (--pers), which is needed for some Equihash-based algorithms.   The second way to configure lolMiner is through the --coin (-c)  parameter. This option sets more detailed settings for the selected profiles and allows you to use special features such as algorithm switches or a combination of an algorithm with the correct personalization.   You can check the detailed list of additional parameters for lolMiner using the lolMiner -h command.

This is necessary to increase the performance of a gpu in mining and not only.   Variety of cards are supported: from and to RX580.   The main features of SRBPolaris are:     unlocking the backup shaders;   Copy memory straps fast and easy   copying / editing time periods of work,   Memory timing strap editor - make your own custom straps   Unlock RX460 additional shaders   Set GPU voltage   Set default GPU and MEM clocks   Lot’s of useful stuff   This program is considered convenient, easy to use, and, importantly, it is more suitable for beginners or those who are busy with other things, and who has no time to delve deeply into something and study.   Acceleration of the video card is achieved by changing the initial settings in the BIOS of the video card, which are used by the operating system and application programs that are read during the initialization of the equipment immediately after turning on the computer.   The firmware of video cards for mining gives a significant increase in performance, for example, the flashed RX 570 gives out 30-40% higher speed when mining, in contrast to the non-flashed version. Bypassing the firmware of video cards, you will most likely need to improve the drivers of the operating system.   After flashing, it is extremely simple and convenient to monitor and control the characteristics of the video card using the GPU-Z and HWinfo programs, the main task of which is to demonstrate the voltage, frequencies, load on the video card and many other information that will be extremely useful.   Overclocking can be easily checked in HWinfo by monitoring video memory errors. With a large number of these errors, it is necessary to reduce overclocking by decreasing the operating frequency of the video memory or flashing less aggressive timings.   SRBPolaris Won’t Start?   The program requires .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)   Install it:        You will see the Windows Installer:        You need to wait about 5-10 minutes.

This article describes how to get started mining with TeamRedMiner 0.8.3 and newer.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download releases from GitHub   Download releases from BitcoinTalk       TeamRedMiner review     TeamRedMiner is an AMD-exclusive mining software developed by programmers Todxx and Kerney666.     This software can mine cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ravencoin, Grin, Zcoin and others.     It is a command line program. This means that you run it from either the Windows command line or the Linux console, or you create shortcuts to predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or Windows command (.bat) file.      How to set up TeamRedMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t \t\t \t\tFirst, you need to download the software from this GitHub Release link. Make sure you select the correct file for your OS. If you have Linux, download the .tar.gz file, if you have Windows, download the .zip file. \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure a batch file for Ethereum  \t\t \t\t \t\tYou need to choose the correct config file (batch file) depending on the algorithm that you want to use for mining. For example binance pool .bat file will look like this: \t\t\t \t\t\tteamredminer.exe -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -u username1.worker_name -p x \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Stat TimRedMiner  \t \t \t \tEdit this file (replace the account name username1 with your account name). You can also change the mining URL, i.e. choose another pool. Then save as a batch file - .bat- if you are on Windows or as a bash file - .sh- if you are on Linux \t  \t \t  \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Team Red Miner Ethereum Setup      stratum stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org   PORT: 4444   Username: Wallet address   Password: Worker Password     To set up a batch file for ETH and etheremine pool, we need to enter 6 commands one by one:           teamredminer.exe - the name of the program to start. Please note that the batch file itself must be in the same folder as the program itself   -a ethash - after the key -a we indicate the algorithm for mining. In this example, Ether is therefore specifieded ethash   -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org - we indicate the address of the pool. This example uses ethermine.   :4444 - after the colon, we indicate the port of the pool. Ethermine has 4444.   -u 0x0c19EfE277b4e64f26c93b3a48A26EeD310421c8 - after that -u we write the address of our wallet to which mining will go.   .trmtest - we indicate the name of the worker after the dot. You can specify any. It is needed for the name of the farm, when you will be tracking statistics on the pool.   This is how the TeamRedMiner batch file for ETH on the ethermine pool will look:   teamredminer.exe -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x0c19EfE277b4e64f26c93b3a48A26EeD310421c8.trmtest -p x   NiceHash Config   Here is a batch file for NiceHesh:   teamredminer.exe -a kawpow -o stratum+tcp://kawpow.eu.nicehash.com:3385 -u 3LZhp4g3m7YWqR4hAPrZsKWbyo7hRBmqvy.trmtest -p x        This is an example for RVN:           kawpow - indicate the mining algorithm. In this case, Ravencoin   kawpow.eu-west.nicehash.com - specify the pool server for nicehash   3385 - we write the port from the pool   3LZhp4g3m7YWqR4hAPrZsKWbyo7hRBmqvy - and a wallet. Important! To mine for nice hash, you need to specify your BTC wallet, and not the coin you are mining.

In this guide, you will learn how to set up and use the T-Rex miner mining software to mine Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download releases from GitHub   Download from the website   Download releases from BitcoinTalk       T Rex Miner review     T-Rex Miner - is a multi-algorithm mining software optimized for NVIDIA graphics cards. This mining software can mine cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin and others.     Miner T-Rex is a command line program. This means that you run it either from the Windows command line, or from the Linux console, or create shortcuts to predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or a Windows batch file.      How to Install T-Rex Miner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t \t\t \t\tFirst, you need to download the software from this link. Make sure you select the correct file for your OS. If you are on Windows, download the .zip file. If on Linux, select the .tar.gz file. From the names of the files, you can see that these are versions of the program for different versions of the CUDA driver for your video card.  \t\t   If in doubt, download everything. \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure a batch file for Ethereum  \t\t \t\t \t\tOnce you download the program, you need to select the correct script file depending on the algorithm you want to use to mine cryptocurrency. Then edit the mining bat file and fill it with the wallet address, worker (farm) name and mining pool URL. Then save it as a .bat file if you are on Windows or bash - .sh if you are on Linux.  Here is an example T Rex Miner .bat file for the Binance Pool:  t-rex -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -u username1 -p x -w worker_name pause  \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Run T-Rex Miner  \t \t \t \t  Double click on the saved or finished start.bat file to start the miner.  \t  \t \t  \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Example T-Rex Miner for Binance Pool      STRATUM: ethproxy+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com   PORT: 8888   Username: username1   Password: x     This is how the ready-made T-Rex Miner bat file for ETH on the Binance Pool will look like        Just replace username1 with the name of your Binace pool account.   Example:   t-rex -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -u username1 -p x -w worker_name pause   If you want to understand how to set up everything from scratch, then you need to enter 5 commands one by one:           t-rex - the name of the program we run   ethash - algorithm for mining   ethash.poolbinance.com - pool address   8888 - pool port   username1 - username from the mining account on the exchange.   To set up a batch file for another coin - Firo (MTP), we need to enter other commands:   @echo off :start t-rex -a mtp -o stratum+ssl://zcoin.mintpond.com:3005 -u aMLjCeLBmBGEJP6dYtWEMdZZuPH4w6uFsK.rig0 -p x goto start pause   Here we added @echo off - it is used so that the extra text of the command itself is not displayed on the screen.

To set up a batch file for solo mining, we need to run the wallet in server mode with port 9999 and enter other commands:   cpuminer-sse2.exe -a scrypt -o http://127.0.0.1:9999 --coinbase-addr DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo  pause   Here we added --coinbase-addr  - used for solo mining.   You can try adding the rpc resolving IP to create .conf file To allow connections only from your local network, you can specify your subnet in the rpcconnect parameter.

If you have upgraded the Google Chrome browser to version 91, you may have noticed that some file downloads don’t work anymore in the browser.   But first, here’s a brief explanation of why this happens, assuming you know the file you’re trying to download is safe. Google Chrome and other web browsers will try and identify possibly malicious files. One minor flaw in this concept is that most web browsers often will flag unknown files as malicious. This is commonly known as heuristics, which is a fancy word for guessing.   But here comes a problem, files considered as unsafe by Chrome might however be “clean.” It can be frustrating when Chrome keeps blocking a download that you know it is from a trusted source.

Ethereum Mining How to create your Ethminer Batch File &amp; Config Setup          subscribe   To increase performance, use the cl-local-work setting in Ethminer NVidia. Set the value to 128 if, in addition to mining on devices, you perform additional work, or 256 if you have a mining farm. The cl-global-work command is used with the default parameter 8192. It is possible to increase the metric by 2 or 4 times to increase the impact.   Applying these settings will increase the mining power by a couple of megahashes. Make sure you have a good cooling system when using, as the GPUs will run at higher operating temperatures. Transfer the batch file to the basic settings, or the hash began to sag or the cards overheat.   Frequent problems   As with other software, miners give errors. Rarely are they critical. Here are the most common ones:           Ethminer no openCl platform found - the error appears if you use graphics processors from NVidia. Here, use the –u command to enable CUDA technology.

GPUs are always made with significant performance constraints. Developers of video cards in this way protect the entire batch from the occurrence of marriage. Thus, the factory sets the frequencies, as they say, “the average for the hospital.” However, in most cases, video cards are capable of operating at higher frequencies.   When it comes to mining or high-demand games, the question is what to use to make a GPU modification. There are also alternatives to the PolarisBiosEditor program.
