(Low Power?) Tested with RTX 3060   GMiner and lolMiner have both released the latest versions of their respective miners, which boast a similar 65-69% unlock for ETH for the LHR cards when combared to NBMiner. However, they apparently now consume less power too! Ill test is out on Zotac Twin Edge OC RTX 3060 to see if that promise holds up!  a 70% ETH Hashrate Unlock for LHR (Limited Hash Rate) GPUs! Time to test it out on my LHR EVGA 3080 &amp; LHR Zotac 3060 Ti! Does it actually deliver on its 70% FHR promise?       subscribe          Lolminer - ETH unlock on RTX 3060 LHR v2, RTX 3070 LHR and RTX 3080 ti   Fantastic video. I'm mining ravencoin with my 8 3060ti on Hiveos. I want to get as many as possible before halving. I'm getting 27.5mhs with core 220, mem 800 and power 145w.        subscribe   Automatic change from ETH to ETC for the Merge   To make an automatic transition to ETC when the ETH pool goes down after Ethereum Merge, you need to have lolMiner 1.88+.   It is as easy as add etc: like this in the Extra Config:   --pool etc:eu1-etc.ethermine.org:4444 --user 0x85Df244a3C8d6442225360bE681B7F7D803c0e78  HiveOS:        RaveOS:        That will continue Mining in this case KASPA and continue doing ETC.   It can be used to dual Mine KASPA or ALPH or simple ETC.   In case you want a SSL just add ssl:// before etc:   --pool ssl://etc:eu1-etc.ethermine.org:4444 --user 0x85Df244a3C8d6442225360bE681B7F7D803c0e78   Commands   To start mining with Lolmeiner, you need to specify three things, namely:      Mining algorithm.   Pool address or solo address to connect.   Username / wallet for mining.        Configure the algorithm for mining   LolMiner has two ways to specify the algorithm you want to mine. You need to choose one of them to start mining.   The first option is --algo (-a) followed by one of the following algorithm names:                  Parameter       Algorithm                       AUTOLYKOS2       Autolykos                 BEAM-I       BeamHash                 BEAM-II       BeamHash                 BEAM-III       BeamHash                 C29AE       Cuckoo                 C29D       CuckarooD                 C29M       CuckarooM                 C30CTX       Cuckaroo                 C31       Cuckatoo                 C32       Cuckatoo                 CR29-32       Cuckaroo                 CR29-40       Cuckaroo                 EQUI144_5       Equihash                 EQUI192_7       Equihash                 EQUI210_9       Equihash                 ETCHASH       Etchash                 ETHASH       Ethash                 UBQHASH       Ubqhash                 ZEL       ZelHash                 KHeavyHash       KASPA           Note that you can always find out the supported algorithms with the command: lolMiner –list-algos. The size of the commission will also be shown. This list will inform you if the program supports the algorithm / requires the personalization parameter (--pers), which is needed for some Equihash-based algorithms.   The second way to configure lolMiner is through the --coin (-c)  parameter. This option sets more detailed settings for the selected profiles and allows you to use special features such as algorithm switches or a combination of an algorithm with the correct personalization.   You can check the detailed list of additional parameters for lolMiner using the lolMiner -h command.   Dual mining   Dual mining is the process of mining two specific coins on the same video card (or mining farm). Thanks to dual mining, you can increase your profit. You can mine ETH/ETC/UBQHASH and Kaspa at the same time.   You need to make sure that on Windows or Linux (HiveOs, RaveOS) you update the program to the latest version.   We must also take into account that the power supply may require a few extra watts. This is because during dual mining, the power consumption of video cards increases, the temperature increases accordingly, as well as the cost of electricity.   Here is what we get after setting up.       Just set up your batch file or flightsheet/profile/wallet ETH/ETC/UBQHASH and go to settings:   For HiveOS   Enter Setup Miner Config and write Extra config arguments.             Select KASPADUAL, then you must specify the address and port of the pool:   Pools  EU: acc-pool.pw:16061 or 162.55.7.43:16061  US: ca.acc-pool.pw:16061 or 144.217.11.196:16061  Rusia: ru.acc-pool.pw:16061 or 185.200.240.114:16061  Asia: hk.acc-pool.pw:16061 or 103.161.224.217:16061   Example:   --dualmode KASPADUAL --dualpool acc-pool.pw:16061 --dualuser kaspa:qrkqwe4kzpd8hv3l4fatgzyzj4l3yygrs2yqx4nvz08lsgzdpqc8zt302prna   &nbsp;          Dual Mining ETH or ETC + Kaspa   3070s non lhr.

Subscribe   For RaveOS   Just select a pool and click on the pencil icon.        There we must add the command:   --dualmode KASPADUAL --dualpool acc-pool.pw:16061 --dualuser kaspa:qrkqwe4kzpd8hv3l4fatgzyzj4l3yygrs2yqx4nvz08lsgzdpqc8zt302prna        &nbsp;          RaveOS Dual Mining Ethereum (ETH) and Zilliqa (ZIL) - ETH+ZIL with lolMiner or Ethereum Classic (ETC)   Command for RaveOS: --enablezilcache --dualmode zil --dualpool eu.ezil.me:5555 --dualuser %WAL%.your_zil_wallet   Please note that in dual mode, the hashrate on Ethereum may drop, and the cards will become very hot, and power consumption will increase.

Releases and updates   1.88   1.65      Improved Kaspa performance in ETC and ETHW dual mining by about 6-7% on AMD (Big) Navi GPUs and 10-12% on Nvidia Turing and Ampere, measured at the same Ethash speed. The actual improvement depends on the concretely selected dual factor. Re-tuning your setup is highly recommended.   Improved Kaspa performance in Kaspa only mining mode by 0.6 to 1.2% on Nvidia GPUs and 0.4-0.5% on AMD (Big) Navi GPUs at approximately same power draw.   Beta feature: Added experimental support for AMD RX7900 series. Supported algorithms: Et(c)hash, kHeavyHash and the corresponding dual mining.   Fixes     Fixed some minor display bugs.   1.64   1.62   1.61   1.56      Major performance increase for Flux mining on Nvidia Ampere GPUs   Major performance increase for Beam mining on Nvidia Ampere GPUs   Mining Flux and Beam on all Nvidia GPUs now uses Cuda instead of OpenCL   Slight performance improvements for Flux mining on AMD RX 500, RX 5000 and RX 6000 (about 0.2 it/s)   Mining any Equihash based coin (Flux, BTG, Aion, …) now supports extra nonce subscription via stratum (e.g. for better profit switching pool experience)   Added option --no-cl to disable detection of OpenCL powered GPUs (fixes a crash on some rigs where the Nvidia OpenCL driver crashes - happens mostly when having a rig with many GPUs)   Fixes:     Disabled DAG checking for ETC mining on 4G AMD GPUs, because this was always failing (investigating to bring it back asap)   Nvidia LHR cards will no longer run the LHR unlock when not mining Et(c)hash or Ergo - this will prevent them from crashing on some other algorithms.   1.55      extensively stepped forward Flux mining performance on AMD RX 5000 (+10% on 5700) and AMD RX 6000 based totally GPUs (+15-22%)   Mining Flux, Beam, Equihash a hundred and forty four/5 and Equihash 192/7 will now show the new iteration/s (it / s) for simpler OC tuning and the pool sol/s calculated from submitted and regular shares.   Flux mining can now be decided on via --algo FLUX without needing to specify --pers.   enabling Equihash one hundred forty four/5 and Equihash 192/7 will now also help --pers as opposed to capital --pers auto for enabling pool automated selection.   added DAG take a look at and restore characteristic for Ethereum classic mining as much as epoch three hundred.   delivered ETH / and so on + Kaspa code for Nvidia Pascal based totally GPUs.   delivered choice to blend extraordinary Ethash style algorithms when using the fail-over pool function. to use this you presently can use eth:, etc: and ubiq: as a prefix on your fail-over pool address to indicate this pool uses a specific set of rules then the one configured first of all. this may permit to mechanically switch from Ethash to an Etchash pool while “the merge” happens as you could configure for regular Ethash mining and configure one of the fail-over pools as Etchash, so when the primary pool receives disconnected or rejects the authorization (these two are anticipated behavior for Eth swimming pools after the merge), then the miner can transfer to a fail-over e.g. configured to mine Etchash. See instance files mine_eth_backup_etc.sh or mine_eth_backup_etc.bat on a way to use it.   Note: when using this feature with prefixes like tls:// or ssl://, then put the new prefix after the prefix for the communication layer. So tls://etc: is valid, while etc:tls:// is not.   Fixes:     Fixed a bug that might cause the digger to crash when an Ergo pool association ought to reconnect. Fixed a bug that can cause arbitrary invalid shared when mining Kaspa on AMD GPUs.   Settled a bug that can cause arbitrary invalid shares when mining Kaspa on AMD GPUs   1.54      Fixed a bug sometimes causing duplicate send shares in Kaspa dual mining.   Fixed a bug “Received a defect stratum message: conversion of data to type “b” failed” on new Kaspa pools and the solo mining adapters.   Fixed a bug causing --dualworker not to work right with Kaspa dual mining.   1.53   1.52   1.51a   1.50   1.49      Improved performance of Nvidia LHR V2 cards in Ethash to 79 - 79.5% (86.5 - 87 % on RTX 3060 V1 and 460.39 driver). Note that dual mode codes remain unchanged.   Added an experimental zombie mode for Nvidia Pascal generation 5GB cards, allowing them to continue mining Ethash after epoch 492 (in Linux).   Reduced fee for LHR unlocker back to 0.7%. Now all Ethash solo codes have only 0.7% fee (again).   LHR cards that have memory junction temperature sensors will automatically throttle LHR unlock by ~0.4 - 0.5% when hitting 106° C memory clock to prevent unneeded locks.   LHR calibration on startup now taking approx 2 minutes instead of 4.   Extended crc table for Ethash up until epoch 550.   Changed default behavior for \".\" signs in wallet address when Ton or Aleph dual mining. These will now automatically separate the string at the given position, so the thing after a . is treated as worker name. -Fixed a bug that may cause TLS connections not cleanly reconnecting after a connection loss.   1.48      Slightly improved initial speed after startup on 510.x &amp; 512.x drivers allowing to reach best performance faster   Made the LHR unlocker more robust against small changes in work load. We still recommend to not put other load then mining during the calibration phase - after that is finished, the miner is more robust.   Full hash rate cards will disable LHR detection latest one minute after --lhrwait has passed. This means that by default one minute after the DAG was created the cards now get “protected” from further detection.   Added Nvidia core junction temperature reading   Change in configuration for making it more comfy: If the number of entries for --cclk, --mclk, --lhrtune or --maxdualimpact matches exactly the number of selected GPUs, the miner will now automatically skip over the inactive devices. E.g. --devices 1,2,4 --cclk 1050,1400,1500 now makes sense, while before --cclk ,1050,1400,,1500 was needed to skip over inactive devices. --lhrtune 0 is now semantically identical to --lhrtune off   Changed handling of user/wallet names containing one or multiple dots. This should fix issues with mining rig rentals and ezil pool. Note: some pool might not like appending your user name with a dot. If so and you get authorization rejected make sure you use --worker instead   Fixed a bug causing LHR unlock not working when too many GPUs needed to perform DAG repair in Aleph dual mining (yea, that is a special case one … )   Fixed a bug causing RTX 3050 &amp; RTX 3080 12GB to have extremely low Ethash performance when dual mining   Fixed a bug causing dual mining hash rate on FHR cards not showing up during dual mine calibration in 1.47   Fixed a bug causing --lhrtune off occasionally not to work in 1.47.   1.47   1.45   1.44      Added experimental Ethash + Ton dual mining kernels for Nvidia Pascal generation GPUs.   Setting the parameter --maxdualimpact to 0 will now completely disable dual mining on this card.   Setting the parameter --dualdevices can now be used to make GPUs mine Ton only in Eth+Ton dual mode. In combination with --maxdualimpact this means one can choose for every card which algorithm to mine.   Automatic tuning for dual mining will now always make sure the parameter is adjusted so the GPUs start on both algorithms if --maxdualimpact is not set. Manually setting --maxdualimpact will disable automatic parameter stretching.   icemining.ca Ton stratum now can use the --pass or --dualpass parameter to apply pool settings.   Fixed a bug that might cause a SIGSEV or SIGPIPE crash on some Linux platforms when reconnecting.   Fixed a bug with icemining.ca Ton stratum not sending correct job id when dual mining on AMD cards.   1.43   1.42   Added ability to lock the memory clock on Nvidia RTX 3000 series. Use parameter --mclk to do so (requires admin / sudo permissions and Nvidia driver 470 series or newer).   1.41b      Improved performance of Nvidia TON kernels, especially significant on Turing based GPUs.   1.40      improved performance of TON solvers by up to 1.5% depending on your GPU;   lowered TON miner fee to 1.5% –&gt; 1%;   increased TON https mining polling interval for less server load;   improved blocking preventing mechanisms lolMiner can now communicate with stratums using websockets starting with wss://;   significantly improved TON mining pool compatibility;   added a new parameter --ton-mode to toggle between modes;   Bug fixes: fixed a bug with TON https polling causing random crashes on some machines; fixed a bug with TON: defect shares were not displayed in stats overview; fixed a bug with TON OpenCL back end: miner did trigger watchdog when a GPU was halted and waiting for work)   1.39   Feature Changes     Added support for mining TON. Use --algo TON to mine it. Developer fee is 1.5%, AMD cards since GCN1 (via OpenCL) and Nvidia cards Maxwell and newer generation (via Cuda) are supported.   Added support for mining Ubiq. Use --algo UBQHASH to mine it. The fee is 0.7% as with all Ethash based coins.   Added support for routing your stratum traffic through a socks5 proxy server. Use --socks5 : to enable it. Note: at the moment this does not work with https traffic as in the TON algorithm. We will work on that.   Fixes     Added a timeout for DOH requests, so they can no longer hang indefinitely.   Fixed ethash support for RX 5500 series GPUs on more recent drivers.   Notes about TON pool connection:  At the moment only the https pool communication protocol is supported. Therefore your --pool address must start with https://. This protocol is not ideal for mining, but we work on establishing a real stratum protocol with some pools in the near future, stay tuned!   Note when using a pool address starting with https:// specifying a port is optional (the default 443 is used when not specifying one). Also when mining TON via https lolMiner automatically uses TLS 1.2 encryption with skipped host name verification. As a final notice: always make sure your TON pool either does not need miner wallet registration or you registered - many popular pools require to register your wallet address to mine it.   Notes about TON performance and tuning:   With regard to tuning for TON: The algorithm needs core, core and more core. Therefore maximizing the core clock within the limits of you cooling and energy supply is the key for the ideal performance. It might be beneficial to reduce the core voltage to produce less heat and less energy consumption - this way the cards keep more distance to their thermal limits and can often clock higher as well. We recommend this algorithm on your AMD RX 6000 cards!   1.37      Added DNS over HTTPS name resolving for establishing your pool connection. This has advantages when your normal DNS resolving might be blocked or modified by a firewall. You can control its behavior with the parameter --dns-over-https value with the values 0: turns DNS over HTTPS off; 1: DNS over HTTPS is enabled, fallback to normal DNS resolving is possible (default); 2: enforcing DNS over HTTPS, normal DNS is completely disables (1)   Updated internal libraries for TLS connection handling   Moved more fee pools to use TLS connection. When mining Ethash, Etchash (both +ZIL), Ergo and Beam the fee connection is now always encrypted (TLS 1.2) and mining data packages can not be identified as such.   Changed LHR kernel defaults for RTX 3060 and RTX 3070, because the default ones had an issue with defect shares at high oc.   1.37   (Note: The windows version will be delayed a bit - we need to make sure first LHR unlocking is working there as expected) Feature Changes     Improved Ethash performance on Turing based graphic cards (GTX 16 series, RTX 20 series, lower tier CMP cards) by about 0.4 to 0.7%.   Improvement of Ethash performance (up to 1%) and reduction of stale share rate for Maxwell and Pascal (GTX 10) based GPUs.   Changes LHR tuning algorithm to minimize the number of locks &amp; time for finding a stable value: The tuning might be improved by the miner later once stable for long enough time.   Improved LHR performance for 3060 V1 (GA106-300-A1) on older drivers (460.39 and earlier)   Added Ergo kernels for RX 6700XT and RX 6600 (XT) on newer AMD drivers.   Ethereum stratum code will now print the pool difficulty in better human readable number   The miner will now print the ip of the connected pool - to be able to detect e.g. faulty DNS entries   Added parameters --dualtls and --dualworker to toggle TLS and the worker name for the dual connection. To be used as with the parameters for the standard connection.   --statsformat can now distinguish between the number of LHR locks “lhrlks” and the current --lhrtune parameter lhrparam   Added a parameter --vstats to modify the terminal width in number of characters to overwrite the automatic detection, which sometimes does not work with some terminal emulators like putty.   Added a parameter --hstats. Given this parameter will switch the statistics to a way such that the statistics write a horizontal line per GPU instead of the default vertical (see screenshot below). When the automatic read terminal width is reached, the remaining entries will be printed to a 2nd set of lines. The vertical statistics can be combined with the usual --statsformat patterns to customize the displayed values per card. The optional number overwrites the the automatic screen width detection. To fit all values of --statsformat extended into one line we need --hstats 150 or higher (recommended setting this value manually when accessing the rig via terminal emulator). Fixes   Fixed 3060 V1 (GA106-300-A1) internal parameters for drivers 460.39 and below, stabilizing the hash rate (they pretty much did not work stably unlocked in 1.36)   Fixed a bug causing a wavy hash-rate report in some FHR rigs   Fixed a bug causing --mode a kernels to be defect for Ampere and Turing GPUs in 1.36(a) releases   Fixed a bug causing a segmentation fault when trying to mine EXCC.   1.36a   Feature updates     Improved Ethash &amp; Etchash performance on all Nvidia Turing &amp; Ampere GPUs by 0.3 to 0.7% depending on card &amp; system.   Decreased rate of stales on Nvidia Turing &amp; Ampere GPUs.   Modified LHR auto tuning to use finer steps (0.2 instead of 1). Also when the miner is more then 2 hours stable on its current settings and a lock appears, the card will unlock again, but the tuning will not be reduced.   New parameter: --lhrwait n will set the miner to wait n seconds, until the LHR detection and calibration gets active. Allows to wait for systems with delayed memory overclock settings.   Fixes     Fixed a potential crash between switching between cached Eth and Zil dag on Nvidia cards   Fixed a bug: Worker name got lost on ezil.me mining pool (since 1.34)   Fixed a bug causing rare defect shares on LHR cards   1.36a: Fixed a bug causing no LHR unlock to normal speed after epoch change   1.36a: Reverted some LHR kernels to a specification more similar to what was in 1.35. These are default in Windows and on RTX 3080 on Linux, other cards can request this kernels by using --lhrtune wauto or wTuneNumber in case the default is unstable.   1.35   Feature changes      Ergo: Adjusted all codes mining Autolykos v2 to be ready for the epoch 1 and higher, starting Sunday Nov 7th ~8 am UTC. To continue mining Ergo, please update to this version. (1)   Ergo: Added ability for all AMD cards to pre-build the next Ergo data set while mining. This is at a cost of slightly slower mining directly after a height change, but generally improves poolside performance. In case you find it unstable the pre-building can be deactivated by using parameter --ergo-prebuild -1 / 0 / 1. Here -1 stands for the cards default, 0 is off, 1 is on. Default is on for all AMD GPUs except GCN1 and Vega generations - those were more stable with the option turned off. The value can be set per card by using a comma separated list of values.   Ergo: Improved performance of AMD Hawaii generation of chips by about 2%.   Ethash: Added error correcting tables to check the DAG integrity up to epoch 499 (Early June 2022)   Ethash: Added option to use the version 1.33 semi-unlocker style - this was more performant for some GDDR6X cards. Use --lhrtune xauto to activate the 1.33 solver style auto tuning and use –lhrtune x to set a predetermined tune value. The 1.33 style solver can be mixed with 1.34+ style solvers by using a comma separated list of values.   Bug fixes     Ethash: Fixed a bug some crashed Nvidia cards did not trigger the watchdog   Ethash: Fixed a bug causing the worker name not to be correctly passed to the pool in some cases in 1.34(a)   (1) The new Ergo epochs will increase the size of the data set used for mining by 5% every ~75 days. Some cards might need a bit more core clock to achieve the used performance. Also 2G cards in zombie mode will see a significant reduction in speed, because the data set is more then 2150 MBytes in size now.   1.34a     Added further epochs to the dag correction detection / table. This can resolve issues with defect shares that appeared in 1.34 or earlier with start of epoch 450.   Slightly changes internal LHR parameters of 3070 ti &amp; 3080 - we hope to improve stability by this plus a small speedup.   1.34     Improved performance of RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti by up to 2%, generally allowing a bit less core clock.   Auto tuning will now be quicker to reasonable hashrates.   Improved stability on found parameters.   Found parameters that are hard coded with --lhrtune are now applied within 30 seconds after dag build.   --lhrtune now understands the parameter “off” to disable any kind of LHR handling - this is useful for cards that sometimes trigger the lhr detection although they are non-LHR.   Improved compatibility with many current drivers. Still on Linux we recommend 470.74 for LHR v2 cards. The 460 series drivers might perform up to 0.5% worse. For 3060 LHR V1 use either 460.39 or earlier driver.   The parameter --workmulti now has effect on Nvidia GPUs on Ethash. Default value is 192, lower values will improve stale count, higher values will reduce CPU load (and can be a tiny bit quicker, although only very tiny).   Added support of RTX A6000 / RTX A5000 / RTX A4000 (and future RTX A2000) Nvidia workstation GPUs.   Reduced RAM usage of Nvidia Ethash solver (some 10+ card rigs got issues with 1.33 when they only had 4G of memory).   --statsformat now understands the string “lhrinfo” to print the --lhrtune parameter and the lock count in custom set up statistics.   Fixed a bug with --tstop or a lost stratum connection triggering a LHR GPU to lock.   Fixed a bug that RTX 3070Ti only triggered the lock detector on rather low memory clock.   Fixed a bug with invalid shares in Pitcairn Ergo Zombie mode.   Improved stability of Ethash stratum and statistics module.   1.33  Core Feature: Complete rework of LHR semi-unlock feature.      Better performance of LHR semi-unlock, about 70%+ on GDDR6x cards (3070 Ti &amp; 3080 (Ti) ), about 71-72%+ on GDDR6 (3060 (Ti) &amp; 3070), 81%+ on 3060 LHR V1 with the right drivers (earlier then 460.39). Recommended driver for LHR v2: 470.74 (Linux), 472.12 (Windows)   Important hint: We saw some calibration bugs with 460.93 driver (Linux). Please do not use it!     Less performance difference between low and high core clock then earlier versions   Cards are automatically detected if they are LHR - no more --mode switch required   In the beginning the miner will calibrate to your exact core &amp; memory clocks. The total process takes 3-4 minutes total, one with rather low speed and the remaining time with speed closer to the final value. Try not to change any overclock after or during calibration, else the performance might be lower then expected!   --lhrtune has now default value of auto for an automatic tuning. Results of automatic tuning will be displayed in stats after calibration is completed. Note: re-tuning of values used in 1.32a is required!   Other feature changes      Default --shortstats interval lowered to 15 seconds, default --longstats interval lowered to 60 seconds   More stable displayed hashrate on Nvidia cards when mining Eth   Changes in Api: On supported algorithms the miner now exposes the number of stale shares in API (stales and defect shares are no longer collapsed into one value)   Fixes:      Fixed a bug with processing old style --dualmode etc dualmine settings   Fixed some minor bugs of the API   Fixed a bug causing a non-realistic high hash rate to be displayed on LHR cards when overclocked after start  ","categories": ["miners"],

This is necessary to increase the performance of a gpu in mining and not only.   Variety of cards are supported: from and to RX580.   The main features of SRBPolaris are:     unlocking the backup shaders;   Copy memory straps fast and easy   copying / editing time periods of work,   Memory timing strap editor - make your own custom straps   Unlock RX460 additional shaders   Set GPU voltage   Set default GPU and MEM clocks   Lot’s of useful stuff   This program is considered convenient, easy to use, and, importantly, it is more suitable for beginners or those who are busy with other things, and who has no time to delve deeply into something and study.   Acceleration of the video card is achieved by changing the initial settings in the BIOS of the video card, which are used by the operating system and application programs that are read during the initialization of the equipment immediately after turning on the computer.   The firmware of video cards for mining gives a significant increase in performance, for example, the flashed RX 570 gives out 30-40% higher speed when mining, in contrast to the non-flashed version. Bypassing the firmware of video cards, you will most likely need to improve the drivers of the operating system.   After flashing, it is extremely simple and convenient to monitor and control the characteristics of the video card using the GPU-Z and HWinfo programs, the main task of which is to demonstrate the voltage, frequencies, load on the video card and many other information that will be extremely useful.   Overclocking can be easily checked in HWinfo by monitoring video memory errors. With a large number of these errors, it is necessary to reduce overclocking by decreasing the operating frequency of the video memory or flashing less aggressive timings.   SRBPolaris Won’t Start?   The program requires .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)   Install it:        You will see the Windows Installer:        You need to wait about 5-10 minutes.

In this guide, you will learn how to set up and use the TimRedMiner 0.10.20 and newer software for mining cryptocurrencies.   Download for Windows / Linux   Download releases from the website Download releases from GitHub Download releases from BitcoinTalk       TeamRedMiner review     TeamRedMiner is an AMD-exclusive mining software developed by programmers Todxx and Kerney666.     This software can mine cryptocurrencies such as Pyrin, Ravencoin, Grin, Zcoin and others.     It is a command line program. This means that you run it from either the Windows command line or the Linux console, or you create shortcuts to predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or Windows command (.bat) file.          How to set up TeamRedMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t \t\t \t\tFirst, you need to download the software from this GitHub Release link. Make sure you select the correct file for your OS. If you have Linux, download the .tar.gz file, if you have Windows, download the .zip file. \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Set up a batch file for Ravencoin mining  \t\t \t\t \t\tYou need to choose the correct config file (batch file) depending on the algorithm that you want to use for mining. For example start_kawpow .bat file will look like this:  \t\t\tteamredminer.exe -a kawpow -o stratum+tcp://pool.woolypooly.com:55555 -u RKzUGLFtdMUQgCstmufnWamA5RwN74yHU8.trmtest -p x  \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Stat TimRedMiner  \t \t \t \tEdit this file (replace the wallet address RKzUGLFtdMUQgCstmufnWamA5RwN74yHU8 with yours). You can also change the mining URL, i.e. choose another pool.

Please note that the batch file itself must be located in the same folder as the program itself   -a pyrin - after the -a key we indicate the algorithm for mining. In this example, pyrin, so pyrin is specified   -o stratum+tcp://de.pyrin.herominers.com - specify the pool address. This example uses herominers.   :1177 - after the colon we indicate the pool port. For herominers it is 1177.   -u pyrin:qrwzxl4640kw2vt9u9js8hrgr4zz5s6vqakhl0j6sgypmgp7uzf82az598rmq - after -u we write the address of our wallet to which mining will take place.   .trmtest - indicate the name of the worker after the dot. You can specify any value. It is needed for the name of the farm, when you will track statistics on the pool.   This is what the TeamRedMiner batch file for pyrin will look like on the pool:   teamredminer.exe -a pyrin -o stratum+tcp://de.pyrin.herominers.com:1177 -u pyrin:qrwzxl4640kw2vt9u9js8hrgr4zz5s6vqakhl0j6sgypmgp7uzf82az598rmq.trmtest -p x   NiceHash Config   Here is a batch file for NiceHesh:   teamredminer.exe -a kawpow -o stratum+tcp://kawpow.eu.nicehash.com:3385 -u 3LZhp4g3m7YWqR4hAPrZsKWbyo7hRBmqvy.trmtest -p x        This is an example for RVN:           kawpow - indicate the mining algorithm. In this case, Ravencoin   kawpow.eu-west.nicehash.com - specify the pool server for nicehash   3385 - we write the port from the pool   3LZhp4g3m7YWqR4hAPrZsKWbyo7hRBmqvy - and a wallet. Important! To mine for nice hash, you need to specify your BTC wallet, and not the coin you are mining.

RX 5700's are now the most efficient GPU for Ethereum Mining R-mode greatly improves efficiency for ethash mining on a range of AMD gpus. It is the most complex and advanced work we've done to date. It is linux only.  \t \t     &nbsp;   At this point we do not anticipate being able to port it to windows.   R-mode contains a number of elements coercing the hardware into working better in an ethash mining setup. In other words, we’re hacking around quite hard. The upside is most definitely worth it. However, the downside is that in rare cases the combination of rig hardware, gpus, opencl version, kernel module simply doesn’t work well. We expect R-mode to work in maybe 95-97% of all cases. When it works as expected, it generally runs very stable.

README highlights:      Added initial FPGA ethash support. See FPGA_GUIDE.txt for details.   0.8.7   Maintenance release with network improvements. No algo changes. No need to upgrade unless you have network issues, see changes below.   README highlights:     General: added offline benchmark mode for (almost) all algos (see --benchmark).   Network: improved situations with the Dev pool failed to connect. error message appearing.   Users in China should preferably run with --dev_location=cn.   Network: added experimental support for DNS-over-HTTPS (see --dns_https and --dns_https_sni).   0.8.6.3     Autolykos2: emergency release to support larger pad size from block 614400. Some GPUs (mainly Vegas) will need higher core clocks to achieve the same performance as previous versions due to larger pads breaking some previous optimizations. More optimizations to come in future releases.   Autolykos2: added argument --autolykos_ignore_diff for certain pools that aren’t compatible with the ERGO reference miner pool implementation.   Progpow: fixed wrong --help text for --prog_micro_tune.   0.8.6.2     Firopow/MTP: added a synthetic algo ‘mtp_firopow’ that will use the correct algo given the system time and shut down the miner at the time of the Firo fork on Oct 26.   Ethash/progpow: split the ethash and progpow algos into separate binaries, mainly for some Vegas that ran into stability issues going from 0.8.5 to 0.8.6.   Autolykos2: added support for Tonga.   Advanced SSL usage: changed the default SSL behavior to not provide a SNI hostname during handshake. This simplifies running tunnels against TLS/SSL ports on public pools. See the updated --help section on the -o argument for how to force a SNI hostname being sent.  ","categories": ["miners"],

Power consumtion is fluctuating in this mode, better be used with locked core clock.   feature: -lhr support decimal value   feature: for LHR GPUs, when mining lock is detected, miner will automatically decrease -lhr value by 0.1, and continue mining. max decrease times is 10, which sums to 1.0   fix: higher CPU usage when set --share-check 0.   39.2      feature: ethash added LHR lock detection and recovery in LHR mode.   fix: ergo more robust protocol handle.   39.1     optimize: ethash improve hashrate of LHR mode 1 - 2%，default value of -lhr changes from 68 to 69，manually set to 70 is also very promising.   fix: kawpow issue of v39.0  ","categories": ["miners"],

In this guide, you will learn how to set up and use the latest version (0.26.8) of T-Rex to mine cryptocurrencies.   Download for Windows / Linux   Download from the website Download releases from GitHub Download releases from BitcoinTalk       Review     T-Rex Miner - is a multi-algorithm mining software optimized for NVIDIA graphics cards. This mining software can mine cryptocurrencies like Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin and others.     Miner T Rex is a command line program. This means that you run it either from the Windows command line, or from the Linux console, or create shortcuts to predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or a Windows batch file.     Fee           Developer fee for most coins is 1% (2% for Octopus, Autolykos2, and their dual mining modes).     The last time the miner was updated was after ETH merge. T-Rex has been “dead” for over 1 year now.  It’s sad to see such reliable miners and developers leave the community without any announcement. Of course it’s their right, but they also made a lot of money with the mining community.

Make sure you select the correct file for your OS. If you are on Windows, download the .zip file. If on Linux, select the .tar.gz file. From the names of the files, you can see that these are versions of the program for different versions of the CUDA driver for your video card.  \t\t   If in doubt, download everything. \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure a batch file for Ethereum  \t\t \t\t \t\tOnce you download the program, you need to select the correct script file depending on the algorithm you want to use to mine cryptocurrency. Then edit the mining bat file and fill it with the wallet address, worker (farm) name and mining pool URL. Then save it as a .bat file if you are on Windows or bash - .sh if you are on Linux.

This leads to much lower power consumption, in my case almost a 20% reduction in wattage without reducing hashrate. Using absolute core clock in a crypto mining software like Trex miner is a new and better way of overclocking your graphics cards that leads to much lower electricity being used which means cheaper power bills!   &nbsp;       T-rex Miner LHR Unlock in HiveOS - Nvidia LHR GPU Partially Unlock Settings in HiveOS      To enable LHR mode, you need to explicitly tell the miner which GPUs are LHR and which are not. This is done by specifying --lhr-tune parameter which takes values from 0 to 8:   0 - disabled (use for non-LHR cards) 1 - lowest hashrate, low chance of LHR lock 4 - recommended starting value for most LHR cards 8 - highest hashrate, high chance of LHR lock   Hive OS parameter ex : \"lhr-tune\": \"4,0,4,8\"          &nbsp;       Phoenix Miner VS T Rex - Which ETHEREUM miner gives the best stats?

Important! Use either a long synonym --algo or a short one -a. You do not need to use this and that together.   Further commands will be separated by commas. First a short synonym, and then long. Remember to use only one variation.   -h, --help - display help information and exit   -v, --version    - Display version and exit   -c, --config \\&lt;config file path&gt;  -  Use config in JSON format instead of batch file (CMD file).   To launch T-Rex from the config.txt configuration file, enter in the console: t-rex -c config.txt   Use the file config_example as a starting point to create your own configuration.   Log File   To start saving logs for T-Rex, add the parameter  --log-path trex.txt  to your mining configuration.   -l, --log-path - Full path of the log file.   --log-path c:\\trex.log or wherever you want it really depend where you want it to be save you can create a folder then type in the full location.   Intensity (–mt)   Memory tweak mode. Range from 0 to 6. General recommendation is to start with 1, and then increase only if the GPU is stable.   Ddefault value: 0 - disabled.   The effect is similar to that of ETHlargementPill. Supported on Pascal GPUs with GDDR5 or GDDR5X memory only. Requires running the miner with administrative privileges. Can be set to a comma separated list to apply different values to different cards.   Example:   --mt 4 (applies tweak mode #4 to all cards that support this functionality) .   --mt 3,3,3,0 (applies tweak mode #3 to all cards except the last one).   How to set up LHR unlock   The software supports LHR unlocking. Follow these steps to enable LHR unlock:      Open bat file (or command line in HiveOs).   Select the device to which you want to apply LHR unlock.   Enter --lhr-tune 68 or any other supported value in the text box.   Save your changes.   Close the settings window.   Repeat the process for other devices.   Available commands to unlock LHR:   --lhr-algo - Specify the second algorithm to use in LHR unlock dual mining mode.   --lhr-coin - Set coin name for --lhr-algo.   --lhr-tune  [Ethash, Autolykos2] LHR tuning value that indicates the percentage of the full speed the miner tries to achieve for LHR cards   (default: -1). Range from 10 to 95.  Available values: -1 - auto-mode (LHR tune is set to 74 (or 68 in low power mode) for LHR cards and 0 for non-LHR) 0 - disabled (use for non-LHR cards) 30 - recommended starting value for most LHR cards in LHR unlock dual mining mode (see --lhr-algo) 68 - recommended starting value for most LHR cards in low power mode (see --lhr-low-power) 74 - recommended starting value for most LHR cards Can be set for each GPU separately, e.g. \"lhr-tune\": \"0,0,74.5,0\" - this will set LHR tuning value to 74.5 for the third GPU.   --lhr-autotune-mode        [Ethash, Autolykos2] LHR auto-tune mode (default: full). Valid values: off  - auto-tune is disabled. LHR tune value is fixed during mining, and will not change \t  no matter how often LHR lock is detected down - LHR tune value will decrease if the miner detects LHR lock full - same as \"down\" but additionally miner will be trying to increase LHR tune value if its stable on the current LHR tune level  --lhr-autotune-step-size   LHR auto-tune step size (default: 0.5). Indicates by how much LHR tune value is changed by the LHR auto-tuner.  --lhr-autotune-interval    LHR auto-tune time interval in minutes (default: 20). Amount of time the GPU must be mining without hitting LHR locks before the miner increases LHR tune value.   Also, if the GPU has triggered an LHR lock, LHR tune value will not decrease if the previous LHR lock was detected more than --lhr-autotune-interval minutes ago.   --lhr-low-power - [Ethash, Autolykos2] Reduces power consumption in LHR mode at a cost of a slightly lower hashrate.   Troubleshooting   GPU idle   Setting Windows virtual memory to 21000 MB should resolve this “GPU idle” error. It can also be a problem of overclocking the video card.   API read only mode   To solve this error, you have to use the command line:   t-rex.exe --api-generate-key &lt;&lt;chooseapassword&gt;&gt;   That will generate a Key, that you can pasted into your --api-key config file entry.   Then you enter &lt;&lt;chooseapassword&gt;&gt; when you are prompted on the web interface.   Releases and updates   0.26.8   0.26.6   0.26.4   0.26.1   0.25.15      (LHR) Extend the new LHR unlock functionality to ETH+ALPH dual mining, and ERGO single mode. LHR tune values aren’t accurate, but once you’ve found a value that’s stable for your GPU, you can set it manually with --lhr-tune and get consistent results across miner restarts.   (LHR) Allow setting “up” and “down” auto-tune intervals separately, e.g. --lhr-autotune-interval 5:120, meaning that in --lhr-autotune-mode full mode the miner will be increasing LHR tune value every 5 minutes, and decreasing it as soon as it starts tripping LHR more frequently than once every two hours.   (LHR) Change --lhr-autotune-step-size default value to 0.1 (previously 0.5)   (LHR) Low power mode can now be set for GPUs individually, e.g. --lhr-low-power 0,1,1,0 - the second and third GPUs will be working in low power mode.If you previously had --lhr-low-power in your config, the equivalent would be --lhr-low-power 1   LHR unlocker is more stable compared to 0.25.12, infinite LHR lock loops should be solved now   (ethash, blake3) Fixed “Duplicate share” issue   IMPORTANT: Required drivers are 510.xx .   0.25.12      Slightly modified the way LHR unlocker works and hopefully made it more stable. If you experience regular LHR locks with T-Rex 0.25.12 from releases, please give this build a go. IMPORTANT: Required drivers are 510.xx . The unlocker will not work with older drivers. Also, DONT specify --lhr-tune or --lhr-autotune-mode, and let the miner pick the tuning values on its own.   0.25.9   0.25.8      Improve ETH+ALPH dual mining performance for LHR cards (high power limit / core clock is important to get high ALPH hashrate).   In order for the miner to re-tune your cards, remove LHR tune values from your config if you previously set them.   --lhr-algo parameter is deprecated and is now an alias for --dual-algo.   Miner uses incorrect worker name for the secondary algorithm if --worker2 is set.   0.25.6      Add ETH+ALPH dual mining support for non-LHR cards.   0.25.2      Add blake3 algorithm (Alephium coin).   Add ETH+ALPH dual mining mode for LHR cards (ETH 68% / ALPH 32% by default).   NOTE: solo mining to Alephium nodes isn’t supported   0.24.8      Add DNS-over-HTTPS support when resolving mining pool domain names (see --dns-https-server for details);   Add an option not to set mining pool domain name in SNI header for SSL connections (see --no-sni);   Resolve domain names through SOCKS5 proxy if --proxy is set;   Display mining pool IP address in console;   (WebUI) Make the monitoring page layout more compact on mobile phones.   Bug fixes:     Miner is not creating a log file when --log-path is specified;   GPU does not get turned off when overheated while mining in dual mode;   (WebUI) Charts are not scaled correctly when zooming in.   0.24.7   Bug fixes:      Some command line arguments don’t take precedence over the values set in a config file (e.g. --lhr-autotune-step-size).   (WebUI) Performance degradation introduced in 0.24.6.   (WebUI) Monitoring page shows a blank page if you had 15M or 2H graph views selected while using an older version of T-Rex.   (WebUI) Impossible to set LHR tune values with decimal point.   HiveOS users: many of you complained that your hashrate on LHR cards is fluctuating too much compared to the Windows version. The reason is HiveOS sets hashrate-avr: 30 for T-Rex causing it to report 30-seconds average hashrate as opposed to 1-minute average (default).   A temporary solution would be to edit your flight sheet and manually add hashrate-avr: 60 to the Extra config arguments field. Otherwise, we’ve been told there will be a HiveOS release that fixes it permanently.   0.24.6      (ethash) Improved LHR unlocker, LHR tune value increased from 71 to 74 by default. The new LHR tune scale is somewhat different, so it’s recommended to let autotune find the optimal parameters (in other words, for the first run, remove --lhr-autotune-mode and --lhr-tune parameters from your bat file if they are set)   (ethash, autolykos2) New --lhr-autotune-step-size and --lhr-autotune-interval parameters for finer control of LHR unlock behaviour   (ethash, firopow) Added ETH+FIRO dual mining (use the same OC settings as ETH+RVN)   (autolykos2) New --dataset-mode parameter to enable/disable double buffer mode:            1 - single buffer mode,       2 - double buffer mode (default)           Added SOCKS5 proxy support (see --proxy parameter)   New --temperature-color-mem parameter to control memory temperature highlighting in console   Bug fixes:     (ethash) RTX 3060 GA104 is not recognised as an LHR card   Veriblock mining is broken since 0.24.2   (Linux) Log file contains ANSI escape sequences   0.24.2     (autolykos2) Enable LHR unlock functionality. See about LHR for more details   (ethash, autolykos2) Add LHR unlock “auto-tune” functionality (it’s enabled by default, see –lhr-autotune-mode in readme   Now the miner will try increasing --lhr-tune if it is stable at the current value, so you’ll find out what the maximum LHR tune your cards can sustain without trying a lot of values manually. If you want the miner to stay at the LHR tune value you set yourself no matter what, use --lhr-autotune-mode off.   Add ETH+ZIL mining mode with an arbitrary ETH pool (not proxying through a ZIL pool) -New parameter --no-new-block-info to stop “new block” messages appearing in miner console   Bug fixes:     (kawpow) Hashrate degradation in version 0.24.0 on some configurations   0.24.0     LHR unlock dual mining mode: You can now mine ETH (~30% of full speed) and other coins (~70%) simultaneously with LHR cards using their full potential. Available combinations along with memory requirements: ETH+ERGO (8GB+) ETH+RVN (8GB+) ETH+CFX (10GB+)   WebUI is not updated yet to reflect second algo stats in dual mode, but will be in future.   (ethash) “standard” LHR unlock changes and improvements:   automatically detect LHR cards even if --lhr-tune is not specified   new parameter --lhr-low-power reduces power consumption in LHR mode at a cost of a slightly lower hashrate (start from –lhr-tune 68)   change of --lhr-tune scale compared to the version 0.23.2, now it indicates a percentage of the GPU’s full hashrate the miner tries to achieve. The old values in the [1-8] range are automatically mapped to the new scale, no configuration change required.   recommended starting LHR tune values: 71 in normal mode, 68 in low power consumption mode (this doesn’t apply to dual mode)   0.23.1     Remove telnet API        Multiple bug fixes       0.21.6            (API) Add timestamp of the last submitted share (last_submit_ts)           Bug fixes:     (autolykos2) Improve compatibility with mining pools   Command line parameter --worker does not take precedence over the one specified in the config file   --fork-at functionality is broken   Cosmetic UI fixes  ","categories": ["miners"],

All the mined coins are transferred directly to ETH wallet:  0x3aa3e06C47caDEf96202D378aB7C407CF46A36A4  If you want to donate or support, simply mine for some seconds some blocks with the command line above, during your tests. Every bit helps.   Config example for Dogecoin      STRATUM: stratum+tcp://dogeminingpool.com   PORT: 3009   Username (wallet): DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo   Password: x     This is how the ready-made bat file example CpuMiner for Dogecoin will look on the dogeminingpool:        Just replace DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo with your own Dogecoin wallet address.   Example:   cpuminer-sse2.exe -a scrypt -o stratum+tcp://dogeminingpool.com:3009 -u DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo.0  pause   If you want to understand how to set up everything from scratch, then you need to enter 5 commands one by one:           cpuminer-sse2.exe - the name of the program we run   scrypt - algorithm for mining   dogeminingpool.com - pool address   3009 - pool port   DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo - the address of the wallet for mining on the exchange.   To set up a batch file for solo mining, we need to run the wallet in server mode with port 9999 and enter other commands:   cpuminer-sse2.exe -a scrypt -o http://127.0.0.1:9999 --coinbase-addr DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo  pause   Here we added --coinbase-addr  - used for solo mining.   You can try adding the rpc resolving IP to create .conf file To allow connections only from your local network, you can specify your subnet in the rpcconnect parameter. You also need to specify the internal IP address of the machine you are connecting the miner to in rpcconnect. Then start the wallet in server mode and use the wallet IP, rpcuser, rpcpassword and rpcport in the miner config file.

In this guide, you will learn how to configure and use Phoenix Miner version 6.2c and later for ETC mining   Download for Windows / Linux        Download latest releases Download from BitcoinTalk Download for Linux       What is PhoenixMiner     PhoenixMiner - is a Ethash (Dagger Hashimoto) cryptocurrency miner. First of all, these are Ethereum Classic, ETHw, Etho and other popular coins. The program works with both AMD and Nvidia video cards. According to the developers, it is the fastest Ethash miner with the lowest fees - 0.65%.         How to set up PhoenixMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 -  Download the miner  \t\t \t\t \t\t Download PhoenixMiner, unzip it into a separate folder and find start.bat.  \t\t   \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Set up a batch file for Ethereum on Binance Pool  \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\tOpen the file start.bat with Notepad ++ or any suitable text editor and edit the file start.bat. You must change the pool login (word after -wal). replace username1  with your pool login, or if there is no registration on the pool, then insert after the -wal address of your wallet.  Here is an example of a Phoenix Miner .bat file for the Binance Pool:  \t\tPhoenixMiner.exe -pool ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -wal username1 -worker worker_name -epsw x -asm 2 -dbg -1 -allpools 1 -mode 1 pause  \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Run PhoenixMiner  \t \t \t \tSave this file and then double click start.bat to start mining. When the word “Accept” is displayed in the CMD window, it means that you have successfully submitted your solution to the pool. Further, mining statistics can be viewed on the pool. It will appear about 15 minutes after the start of mining. \t  \t \t  \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     PhoenixMiner example for Ethermine      STRATUM (pool address): eu1.ethermine.org   PORT: 4444   Username (-wal): 0xBB942274AB3C8285400519e7F0c343Fca2394908    Password: default     This is how the **PhoenixMiner batch file for ETH will look like on the Ethermine pool **           To set up a batch file for ETH, we need to enter 5 commands one by one into the .bat file:           PhoenixMiner - the name of the program we are launching.   eu1.ethermine.org - the address of the mining pool.   4444 - pool port.   0xBB942274AB3C8285400519e7F0c343Fca2394908 - the address of the wallet to which the mining is going.   This is how the finished Phoenix Miner batch file will look like:   PhoenixMiner.exe -pool eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -wal 0xBB942274AB3C8285400519e7F0c343Fca2394908   Pay attention to the syntax. In no case are extra spaces, symbols, line breaks allowed. If there are extra characters, then Phoenix Miner will not start.   PhoenixMiner setup for NiceHash   Here is a batch file for NiceHesh:   PhoenixMiner.exe -pool stratum+tcp://daggerhashimoto.eu.nicehash.com:3353 -wal 16p3MvQB7Va2cAPBahvkBePxqQtwTd77sP -pass x pause   Each example has a word at the end of the .bat file pause. This will help keep the CMD window always open. Even if you made a mistake in the syntax. In this case, the CMD console will display an inscription what the error is.   PhoenixMiner setup for Ethereum Classic   Here is a batch file for Ether Classic:   PhoenixMiner.exe -pool eu1-etc.ethermine.org:4444 -wal 0x7b9cc9270cF06889a4286221931D3a58e627F888 -worker Phoenix -pass x pause   And for the Nanopool:   PhoenixMiner.exe -pool etc-eu2.nanopool.org:19999 -wal 0x7b9cc9270cF06889a4286221931D3a58e627F888 -worker Phoenix -pass x   Monitoring and profit   After the miner sends several solutions (in about 10-15 minutes of work), you can check the status of work and profit on the “Income” page in your account on the exchange or on the pool that you have chosen.

Example:  PhoenixMiner.exe -pool ssl://eu1.ethermine.org:5555   -wal &lt;wallet&gt; - Wallet (some pools require adding a login and / or worker).   Example with a wallet:  -wal 0xBB942274AB3C8285400519e7F0c343Fca2394908   Login example:  -wal username1   -pass &lt;password&gt; -  Password (for most pools it is not required, use it x as a password if you are not sure that the pool has a password).   -worker &lt;name&gt; -  The name of the worker (most pools accept it as the name of your farm or wallet, you can specify any).     If  is specified, then instead of  you need to substitute a number without symbols &lt;&gt;.   -proto &lt;n&gt; - Selects the type of stratum protocol for the ethash pool:           miner-proxy - stratum specification for mining in proxy mode (for example, for the Coinotron pool)            eth-proxy - (eg for ethermine pools, nanopool) - this is the default, works for most pools.            qtminer (e.g. ethermine, ethpool)            EthereumStratum/1.0.0 (for example for nicehash)            EthereumStratum/2.0.0       I can give you a snippet here that you can modify to your needs, the complete script covers much more - management of phoenix with OC params, wallets, pools, restarts and much more.

If you have upgraded the Google Chrome browser to version 91, you may have noticed that some file downloads don’t work anymore in the browser.   But first, here’s a brief explanation of why this happens, assuming you know the file you’re trying to download is safe. Google Chrome and other web browsers will try and identify possibly malicious files. One minor flaw in this concept is that most web browsers often will flag unknown files as malicious. This is commonly known as heuristics, which is a fancy word for guessing.   But here comes a problem, files considered as unsafe by Chrome might however be “clean.” It can be frustrating when Chrome keeps blocking a download that you know it is from a trusted source.   See: How to Stop Chrome from Blocking Downloads        Releases   6.2c      Using newer AMD RX470/480/570/580 kernels even on older drivers (from Linux driver 19.10). If you want to revert to the older kernels on these drivers, use the new command line parameter -clabi 1   Added a workaround for the SSL pools with self-signed or expired SSL certificate: you can use the new command-line parameter -weakssl (for the pool specified by -pool), or -weakssl2 (for the pool specified by -pool2), or the new WEAKSSL: 1 option for the pools in epools.txt. Note that this option must be specified independently for each pool: if you use -weakssl on the command line (or in config.txt), it won’t affect the pools specified in epools.txt. Instead you need to add WEAKSSL: 1 for each desired pool in epools.txt   Fixed a crash with Nvidia cards on some older drivers (e.g. 460.79, and 460.89). If PhoenixMiner crashes or exits while showing “Initializing NVML…” try the new command line parameter -nvmalt   Other small fixes.   6.1b      Fixed an issue with expired SSL certificate that led to certificate verify failed errors when connecting to some pools (notably Ethermine) when using SSL connections.   Now the miner will send SSL SNI host name which may be needed by some pools for SSL certificate validation. To go back to the old behavior (no SNI host name), use the new command-line parameter -nosni   Other small fixes.   6.0c      Implemented partial unlocking of Nvidia LHR cards. By default they are detected automatically, and unlocked with the default unlock intensity (520). If you want to try higher (or lower) LHR unlock intensity, use the new -lhr command line parameter. For example -lhr 580 will try more aggressive unlocking than the default 520 unlock intensity. This parameter may (and should) be specified for each GPU separately as some GPUs can support higher unlocked speeds.   If an Nvidia LHR card locks up because of high -lhr (the default 520 will work with most cards), the card will be unlocked again, and the -lhr value will be lowered if necessary.   Added support for new AMD Windows drivers up to latest driver version 22.2.3.   Added support for new AMD Linux drivers up to latest driver version 21.50.   Multiple other small fixes and improvements.   5.9d      Added support for the latest AMD Linux drivers 21.40.1. There are some bugs in these drivers, particularly the clocks and voltages can’t be set properly with older cards (RX4x0/RX5x0/Vega/RadeonVII);   Validated support for the latest AMD Windows drivers up to 21.11.2;   Fixed issues with AMD RX6700XT cards with the latest AMD and Linux drivers;   Fixed issues with AMD Vega and Radeon VII cards on latest Windows and Linux drivers;   Fixed crash with very old Nvidia drivers (3xx.x);   Other fixes and small improvements   5.9c      Show the GPU vendor name in the list of GPUs to make it easier to identify the GPUs.   5.9b   The updated list of known issues (driver incompatibilities, etc.) and workarounds:      AMD Linux driver 21.40.1 has a bug preventing proper setting of clocks and voltages on older cards (RX4x0/RX5x0/Vega/RadeonVII). Given that these drivers are also usually slower than the older drivers for these cards, we recommend using Linux drivers 20.30 for anything older than RX6000 series.   If you are using Linux drivers 21.40.1 with Radeon VII cards, you need to add the option -fpwm 1 in order to have proper fan control.   AMD Linux drivers 21.40.1 has finally removed the requirement of PCIe atomics but there are problems when you try to mix Polaris (RX4x0/5x0) cards and Vega or newer cards on the same rig.   Some Nvidia cards will report a lot of stale shares under Windows 11. Using the same driver version under Windows 10 resolves the issue.   5.8c      Fixed a crash on Linux when mining on RDNA2 AMD cards (RX6x00) with older drivers   Removed error messages when mining on fanless Nvidia cards   5.8b      Implemented optimized kernels for AMD RX6600XT cards;   Added support for the latest AMD Windows drivers (21.10.2, 21.10.1, 21.9.2, and 21.9.1). Note that any AMD cards older than Polaris (RX470/480/570/580/590) won’t work with the latest AMD drivers;   Added support for the latest AMD Linux drivers 21.30;   The latest AMD drivers (21.9.1 and later for Windows, and 21.30 and later for Linux) dropped support for the older kernels, so we changed the kernels for AMD Polaris cards to support these new drivers. There is a very small speed improvement (less than 0.1% on average) with the new kernels and the new drivers on Polaris cards;   Other fixes and small improvements.   5.7b      Implemented new “turbo” kernels (-clkernel 3) for AMD Polaris cards that can work with the current DAG sizes over 4 GB. Note that -clkernel 3 uses double the VRAM and will provide slightly faster hashrate with slightly higher power consumption. You can use the -rvram command-line parameter to specify how much VRAM to be left unused;   Increased the maximum supported DAG epoch to 600 (i.e. until about Sep 2023);   Implemented full hardware control for AMD RX6900/6800/6700 cards under Linux. Note that with these cards under Linux you need to specify relative core voltage: e.g. -cclock -50 will set the core voltage to be 50 mV under the default value;   Added ROCr kernels for Vega, Radeon VII and Navi cards. With these kernels you will be able to run these cards with Linux drivers 20.45 and later but the performance will be lower than with the older PAL drivers and kernels. We recommend using AMD Linux driver 20.30 for all cards except RX6900/6800/6700;   Fixed an issue causing crashing with some RX6900/6800/6700 cards under Linux (there is no need to run these cards with -clkernel 0 anymore);   Added support for AMD Windows drivers up to 21.7.2. Note that Radeon VII cards will not work with drivers 21.6.1 or higher - you need to use older drivers for proper operation of these cards;   Added support for AMD Linux drivers up to 21.20 (use older drivers for Vega or Radeon VII cards as they will not work with 21.20)   Numerous other fixes and small improvements.   5.6d      Fixed problem with displaying GPU temperatures of some Nvidia GPUs.

Yes, Trust Wallet is a secure wallet for Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies.   Recovery phrase   For ease of use, the application encrypts the private keys of all assets to create a single master private key, which is then run through an algorithm to generate a unique 12-word phrase known as the recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase.   Upon registration, you will be assigned a wallet in which you must immediately back up your recovery phrase.        A SEED phrase is essentially all of your private keys converted into a human-readable twelve-word format. This is critical to the security of your wallet because whoever has the recovery phrase has access to all the funds in your wallet. Also, without it, you won’t be able to access your funds if you lose your device.   This is why you must carefully write down each word in the correct order and keep it in several safe places.   While some people save their 12-word SEED phrase in password-protected note apps, keeping it offline is a safer option.        Make sure you write it clearly on a piece of paper in the correct order, double-check the words, and keep it in a safe place.    How to retrieve your “Secret Recovery Phrase” on Trust Wallet       Here’s a video tutorial on how to retrieve/get your secret recovery phrase on Trust wallet to backup your assets/account safely in any case you lost your phone are access to it.

Click on ‘Wallet’.   Touch the “i” icon to view the recovery phrase.   Copy and store in a safe place.        Add extra security: passcode with/without Touch ID or Face ID   The next step after backing up is to add an extra layer of security by adding a passcode. Adding a password makes it harder to access your wallet, send crypto, or change your PIN if your phone is stolen.   Here’s how to do it:     Go to settings.   Click on “Security”.   Turn on ‘App Lock’ and enter your password.        You can set the auto block time to:     immediate,   5,   10 minutes,   1 hour or   5 o’clock.   You can also enable Touch ID or Face ID to unlock your wallet, depending on your device.   Beware of phishing!   Phishing is an attempt by attackers to manipulate users into revealing confidential information in order to gain access to their funds.   Here’s how it works: The scammer creates a clone of the Trust Wallet website or social media pages and asks you to complete some tasks, including giving away your recovery phrase, in order to receive a reward. Others will write to you directly, masquerading as administrators who are looking for solutions to your problems.   Look at the example below.   To avoid becoming a victim of phishing, remember the following:      No administrator on social networks - Facebook, Twitter and Telegram - will ask you to send a recovery phrase for any reason.   The first person to message you on any social media page is most likely a scammer and you should immediately report and block them.   Your recovery phrase belongs only to you. There is no reason to share it with anyone else, no matter who they are or what they say.   Limit your connection to third party sites   Connecting your wallet to a third party site (trusted or not) increases your vulnerability to phishing attacks. This is especially true for iOS users who still use Wallet Connect to link their wallets to DApps.   However, the good news is that you can enable the DApp browser in your wallet in just two steps:     Open Safari and go to trust://browser_enable   A pop-up screen will appear asking you to open a page in Trust.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to download and how to use MyCrypto v 2.5.64 and newer.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download releases Official site       What is MyCrypto?     MyCrypto -  is a cryptocurrency wallet created by the founder of MyEtherWallet. It works with Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens . Can integrate Ledger Nano S, Trezor and other popular hardware wallets or desktop applications. Also, here you can exchange ERC-20 coins not only with ETH, but also with other cryptocurrencies.      Review           The creator of the MyCrypto wallet is Taylor Monahan, the founder of the popular cryptocurrency wallet MEW. At one time, he left the project, taking part of the team. In 2018, he released his own wallet, calling it a direct competitor to MyEtherWallet. In fact, it is a fork, and therefore the interface will be familiar to many. For the exchange of cryptocurrencies, a special service is involved here, implemented directly into the program. The application runs on a PC.           How to use  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download and Install  \t\t \t\tThe cryptocurrency wallet can be downloaded from the official website mycrypto.com. When choosing, make sure that this application is suitable for your operating system, be it Windows, Mac or Linux.

Since everything is simple with the secret phrase: write it down separately, keep it like the apple of your eye and enter it as needed; then we will describe in the article how to work with the keystore. It is a key store. To create it, you need to click on \"Generate a Keystore File\". After that, the system will ask you to enter a password.        It says here that you need to create the most difficult combination. In this case, there must be a different case (uppercase and lowercase letters), as well as a number. The harder you come up with a password, the better. However, we recommend that you write it down somewhere so as not to lose it. Then click on the \"Create New Wallet\" button.  Save your Keystore file     This stage is very important, and the system will inform you about it.   The file needs to be protected, as it stores the private key that gives access to your wallet. It is best to save it to third-party media in several ways so as not to lose it. To do this, connect the USB flash drive and click \"Upload file\". Select the path to your USB stick and save. Then click on \"Continue\" to finish setting up the program.  Save your private key     The system will offer to save the private key in the form of a paper wallet. To do this, she will print it in the form of a QR code.      If necessary, you can simply scan it in the future to gain access to your cryptocurrency wallet. MyCrypto users in their reviews talk about the convenience of such storage. This completes the procedure for creating a cryptocurrency wallet. You can enter it by clicking \"View and Send\". The section is located at the top left.  After that, the system will ask for the choice of gaining access to the cryptocurrency wallet in order to carry out the operation. To do this, you can use:      keystore file, private key or secret phrase.  The latter is also called a seed password or mnemonic phrase.     When choosing a file, the system will offer to load it from the media. To do this, connect the USB flash drive, open the file through the wallet and enter the password. Then click the \"unlock\" button.          The wallet will display all the wallet data. The top right shows:  address (public key used to transfer tokens to the account) Below is the balance of your account. In the middle, it is displayed in fiat currency.     \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     How to transfer and use tokens   Naturally, you can transfer digital coins to other cryptocurrency wallets. To do this, in the wallet, you need to select the item for sending Ether and tokens. It is located in the corresponding section. To carry out the operation, unblock the wallet using the method of your choice.   You will see a window where you need to specify:         Address - the private key to which you want to send coins.   The amount you want to transfer and the type of coin.   Set your transaction fees.   Check the entered data and click “Send Transaction”. If you wish, you can set the commission manually. To do this, click on the “Advanced” button. Then confirm the operation.   After completion, you will see a window about the successful completion of the procedure. The system will also provide a link where you can check the status of the operation and its confirmation. For this, the wallet uses the Etherscan service.   How to use ERC-20 coins   There are two ways to use tokens in MyCrypto:   If digital coins are already known to the program. Here you can click the “Scan For Tokens” button.        At the bottom right, the system will automatically detect them. At the end of the identification, add the ones you need from the list to your wallet. To do this, check the boxes next to the cryptocurrency of interest, and then click the “Save” button. When finished, they will be displayed in the wallet.   If you want to use a digital coin that the crypto wallet does not yet know, then you need to register it yourself. This procedure will be somewhat more complicated.   To register a new ERC-20 cryptocurrency, you need to go to the Etherscan portal. In the search box, enter the name of the digital coin you want to add. The site contains all known tokens and data on them. It will return the result with the address of the contract. Your task is to copy the decimal places, the coin symbol, as well as the address itself. Go back to the wallet and go to the same section. Then click “Add your token”.   A window will appear for you where you need to specify the address, decimal places and the symbol of a digital coin, click “Save”. If everything is done correctly, then the cryptocurrency will be added to your wallet.   What are the reviews?   The wallet has received positive reviews in terms of reliability, not only for ease of use, but also for additional functionality. One of the options is transaction tracking. To do this, you need to insert a hash of the operation to check the status and how many confirmations the transaction has received.   It also has a built-in exchange service. It can be used to quickly convert Ethereum to Bitcoin or ERC-20 digital coins. The wallet provides a section for developers. Here you can see how to create or add new smart contracts to the Ethereum blockchain network. You can transfer transactions that were created and signed automatically.   Is the wallet safe?   With wallets like Mycrypto, you keep your private key in full, so you are responsible for keeping it safe. In case you lose it, the project team will not have a backup in their database. Thus, special care must be taken to prevent attackers from obtaining a copy of the private key.   For security:      Make sure you are not visiting phishing sites. Try installing the MetaMask or EAL browser extensions, which will warn you whenever you accidentally visit a crypto phishing webpage.   Do not use a wallet to store large funds. For such storage, use any of the hardware devices recommended by Mycrypto: Ledger, Trezor, or Keepkey.   Avoid visiting random URLs.   The app is very similar to MyEtherwallet and is considered MEW’s biggest competitor. If you are going to use an Ethereum wallet on your desktop, Mycrypto is much safer than MEW as it does not require you to use the wallet in your web browser, which is much more risky.   Overall, MyCrypto is very user-friendly. Even a beginner will be able to cope with the wallet, since the functionality and interface are intuitive. Developers actively keep in touch with users.

It is also called the address or wallet number for convenience.   It is important to understand that only you should have the private key. Do not pass it on to third parties as it provides access to your cryptocurrency wallet. A public address is used to receive and transfer tokens. Press the button next to the number 1.        A window will open:      with your public address, which can be shown to everyone (“My wallet address”)   and a private key (“My private key”) which cannot be shown to anyone.

Download for Windows / Linux   Download from site Download releases Download from BitcoinTalk       What is CGMiner?     CGMiner - is an open source miner for ASIC, GPU and FPGA. It works on Windows, Linux and macOS. CGMiner is extremely flexible in terms of platform and can work with a variety of hardware miners and GPUs including AMD, CUDA and NVIDIA platforms.     Supported algorithms           The program supports the following algorithms:          Scrypt     SHA-256     NeoScrypt     CryptoNight       While developing the program, programmers focused on the performance of their software. Therefore, it is not the most convenient to use. In fact, the console is used for management with the introduction of certain commands, but there is no graphical shell. As a result, it can be difficult for beginners to operate this software.          How to use CGMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the program  \t\t There are two options to download the program:  Official website of the developer..  On the GitHub site.     On the official website you will find a complete instruction with a description of all the commands of the program. The address of the official page on GitHub  is here. This way you can be sure that the program is safe and free of malware. Do not use third-party sources - you can lose access to data and your tokens.       \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tШаг 2 - Set up the program  \t\t \t\t Settings are entered through the console. We recommend using a batch file (a text file with an extension .bat) for more convenience. In it, you can save all the necessary data so that you do not enter them when you restart the program again. Using the coinfoundry example, the batch file will look like this:  setx GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 0 setx GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE 100 setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1 setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 setx GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 cgminer --scrypt -I 10 -o stratum+tcp://pool.coinfoundry.org:3151 -u DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo.my_worker_password -p my_worker_password -T  pause  Enter instead DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo your Dogecoin wallet address.   \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Start the miner  \t The miner is launched by double-clicking on the file with the extension .bat.

The main .bat file setting has the following data:   Cgminer –scrypt –o stratum+tcp\\\\:pool_address:port –u wallet.1 – p x   Here:      Cgminer –shows the file used to run the miner.   -scrypt – an indication of the algorithm used to obtain the digital token that the miner should use.   -o – after it you need to specify the address of the pool with the port. Take them in the pool where you are going to mine. You can find it in the “Getting Started” category.   -u user – displaying the login that was used when registering on the pool, here enter the name of the worker, which was made there.   -p x – enter the password that was used to create the worker.   This completes the configuration of the bat file.

Sets the metric automatically.   -auto–gpu – sets the GPU frequency to maintain a certain temperature. Works automatically.   -device (-d) – defines a specific video card. By default, the program launches everything it detects. The value of the card is placed next to it (for example, -device 1).   Disable GPU   -disable-gpu (-G) - disabling graphics processors.        -gpu-threads (-g) - setting the amount of threads on the graphics processor. The indicator is set from 1 to 10. By default, the program sets 2. The value is placed next to the command - -gpu-thread.   -gpu-dyinterval - setting the refresh period in milliseconds for video adapters using dynamic intensity. Standard cost -gpu-dyinterval.   -gpu-engine-  setting the frequency indicator for the video adapter. It is permissible to enter both one indicator and a whole range. It looks like this: -gpu-engine 700 or 700-900.   -gpu-fan - setting the fan speed in percentage, a certain value or range. It looks like this: -gpu-fan 50 or 50-65.   -gpu-map - matches OpenCl with ADL hardware number manually or paired CSV. For example, 1: 0.2: 1 shows OpenCl 1 over ADL 0.2 over 1.   -gpu-memlock - setting the memory frequency. In the case of bitcoin mining, we recommend lowering it, for litecoin - raising it. Looks like that: -gpu-memlock   -gpu-memdiff - sets the specific difference between kernel and memory. The indicator is entered in megahertz. It looks like this: -gpu-memdiff ???.   -gpu-powertune - GPU powertune installation. The value is selected in%.   -gpu-reorder - re-sorting video cards.   -Gpu-vddc - change the voltage on the core. The data is entered in this form: -gpu-vddc125.   -intensity (–I) - sets the intensity. The range of selectable indicators is from one to 14. Setting the value “d” - indicates that the indicator is dynamic. It looks like this: -intensity 10 or d.   -kernel (-k) - specifying the kernel for the hardware. It can be diablo, poclbm, phatk, diakgcn. It looks like this: -kernel diakgcn - help is needed in choosing kernels for GPUs.   -ndevs (-n`) - displays a list of graphics processors, number and outputs.   -temp-hysteresis - the temperature difference in ℃ from the expected indicator is indicated. The standard cost is 3. It looks like this:-temp-hysteresis   -temp-overheat - temperature, specified in ℃, when dropping core frequencies. This is where the coolers work faster (rpm increase). Fitted as standard 85. It looks for example like this: -temp-overheat 95.   -temp-target - the desired temperature is set. The value is in degrees. Standard costs 75. It looks like this: -temp-target 90.   -vectors (-v) - sets the width of vectors. By default, the indicator is selected automatically, but you can specify your own: 1, 2 or 4. Here it is indicated as follows: -vectors   -worksize(-w) - the size of the memory is set. However, it has virtually no effect on performance. Automatic selection of the indicator is standard. When self-introduction, select it in multiples of 64: 64, 128, etc. Recommended 256. Looks like this: -worksize   How to set up in windows 10?    setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 2 cgminr.exe –srypt –worsize 512 –intensity 10 –auto-fan –lookup-gap 4 –thread-concurrency 25614 – gpu-engine 1050 –gpu-memlock 1500 –gpu-powertune 15 –o stratum+tcp: east1.us.stratum.dedicatedpool.com:3352 u worker -p XXX   where XXX is the worker password.   Please note that the miner is also compatible with Linux and OSX. In the case of Linux, you can also enable remote access. However, it will not be possible to configure the operation of the video adapter as efficiently as on Windows.          How to Setup CGMiner to Mine Cryptocurrencys (Litecoin &amp; Dogecoin)      subscribe   Review   The program is aimed exclusively at experienced users who are mining cryptocurrencies. Consequently, the functionality is versatile. The software was launched back in 2011. Since then, it has only improved and increased its positive qualities. The launch was made with open source code, which allows you to be confident in the reliability of the software.   The main developer was Kon Kolivas. He is also known for contributing to the development of Linux. At the same time, he is an anesthesiologist by profession, developing programs for him is a simple hobby.   The program is recognized as the most effective software for the extraction of electronic tokens using AMD and NVidia video adapters.   The software allows you to improve the performance of video adapters, making it possible to fine-tune graphics devices.        Most of the known digital coins can be mined on these algorithms. It is used in the mining of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Monero, Litecoin and other well-known digital tokens. Provides a number of benefits:      Allows you to overclock GPUs, providing excellent functionality.   You can adjust the rotational speed of the coolers used in cooling systems.   The algorithms used provide the most efficient cryptocurrency mining.   You can enable automatic switching between workers.   Work with the use of proxy servers is available.   There is no commission for using the program. Hence, it is 100% free.   There is a balancing of the algorithm.   If the workers are not working, the program will disable them.   Key features   The official site allows you to download the software for free. However, please note that the latest versions of the program focused exclusively on ASICs and FPGAs, since the developers decided not to continue to support mining on CPUs and video processors. It is worth using old software releases for them. These include versions prior to 3.7.8.   Basically, it is worth working on AMD, since the software does not work well with CUDA. For NVidia, it is better to choose another miner, for example, Claymore.   The program has several interesting points. One of them is the introduction of tools to overclock GPUs and set the desired fan speed in the cooling system. True, it is worth using this functionality carefully, since there is a high chance of spoiling the equipment and sending it to the scrap.   The program also provides configuration information, automatically turns off the worker, causing problems or simply not working. You can use proxy, balance loading strategy and Round Robin. Thanks to this, miners can independently enter the parameters of the width of the vectors, the waiting time for the connection restoration, create a specified delay for the router and configure a separate display of notifications. The work of the program is configured through a special configuration file.   Conclusions   There are a huge number of cryptocurrency programs that help set up equipment for mining digital tokens. They are called miners - this is special software that allows you to make the equipment work as efficiently as possible. However, not all of them are successful, some have poor functionality, others have a complex interface. Cgminer is one of the few programs that has proven its effectiveness empirically. It is used by a huge number of miners around the world.   A very simple and lightweight miner that can combine ASIC, FPGA and even GPU and CPU technologies. It can be used on many operating systems from Linux, Mac and Windows.  ","categories": ["miners"],

After completing the procedure, you can install a more frequent update using the program to customize the video card in more detail.   Review   The program is compatible with Catalyst 15.12 - Crimson 18.2.3 driver. It can be used in future versions if it finds the settings you want.   Requirements  The patcher doesn’t require much. It is suitable for Windows starting from the Vista series and all subsequent versions, up to the latest “ten”. Graphics editor from AMD / ATI should be 5000 series and newer.   With R9 cards from 285 to 295X2, it becomes possible to better handle frequencies with an increased resolution without using CrossFire.   Compatibility  Each version is capable of working with a specific driver package, like this:      4.7 will fit the series up to 20.5.1.   4.8 is coming up to 20.5.1 and newer.   4.9 will approach Catalist 11.9 and Adrenaline 20.12.2.   The program is not working? Solutions   If Atikmdag patcher does not start, then remove the patcher and download again. The file may have been corrupted during the download. Download only from trusted sources.   Atikmdag sys: blue screen of death          Video: Fix system thread exception not handled     subscribe   Quite often, an error is displayed on a blue screen Atikmdag sysas a result of incorrect installation of drivers. Its damage is also often to blame. The problem occurs on AMD and ATI Radeon graphics cards. Most often, it is enough to reinstall the drivers or update them to get rid of the problem. However, this does not always help.   Code 0x0000003  This code indicates a completely different problem. Most likely there was a conflict when working with the video driver Win32K. The problem is not difficult to fix. Just download the correct version of the patch. When installing the video driver, be sure to run the program update to automatic mode.   File replacement   When a new version of the program is launched, the old file is sent to System32\\drivers. The result is the use of the operating system of the old program. Windows does not use the new one. The result is a blue screen of death (BSOD).          Video: Blue screen error atikmpag.sys/atikmdag.sys Complete FIX     subscribe   To get rid of the problem, you need to replace the file, following the instructions:      Head to the operating system section. This location is often the hard drive “C”.   Navigate to the folder address System32\\drivers.   Find atikmdag.   Give it an extension .sys.old.   Go to your hard drive C.   Open the folder ATI.   Find sys.   Transfer to your desktop.   Open a command prompt via start.   Enter chdir Desktop, confirm your entry.   Enter the command Expand.exe atikmdag.sy_ atikmdag.sy   Copy the new file on your desktop and send it to your drivers folder.   Reboot your system.   As a result of these actions, the problem should be completely eliminated. If this did not happen, the update of the video drivers did not help, we recommend that you check the hardware itself.   Version history   1.4.12  Updated for 21.9.1/21.9.2. Fixed CrossFire limit.   1.4.11  Updated for 21.6.1-21.7.2. Fixed Radeon Software issues.   1.4.10  Updated for 21.4.1.   1.4.9 Version 1.4.9 is new. It can work with Catalyst 11.9 as well as Adrenalin 20.12.2. It will also work for the following GPU models if it can find the limitations you need.   1.4.8 The program will be able to work with video drivers from 20.5.1, where the file has already been named amdkmdag.sys. It will ensure it works properly. There should be no errors in use.   1.4.7 Can be used when installing drivers not higher than version 20.5.1. Also capable of supporting SL-DVI / HDMI limitation.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up and use OhGodAnETHlargementPill r2, r3 and newer.   Download for Windows/Linux        Download from GitHub Download from GitHub (R2)       What is OhGodAnETHlargementPill     OhGodAnETHlargementPill - is a mining pill designed for users of Nvidia graphics cards based on GDDR5X video memory (GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti). It significantly increases the hash rate when mining cryptocurrencies using the Ethash algorithm (Dagger Hashimoto). The program is available for both Linux and Windows.     ETHlargementPill was released for GDDR5X memory only. All you need to do to increase the hashrate of Ethereum (ETH) or another Ethash based cryptocurrency to 50 MH/S on a GTX 1080 Ti (up to 40 MH/s on a GTX 1080) is to run it along with your miner.      Relevance and alternatives       NiceHash QuickMiner already includes the same functionality and is 100% safe to use. Use QuickMiner instead.   In 2021, OhGodAnETHlargementPill is no longer needed if you are using PhoenixMiner. You should use the command -straps 2 for the same effect.   In another mining program - NBMiner, use the command -mt. It does the same thing as a pill. This setting is enabled when mining on 1080 and 1080ti GPUs.   If you still need a “tablet”, then it comes with the NiceHash client.   If you nevertheless decide to use this software separately.

For example:   all gpus:  \"mt\": 4,  or a specific gpu`s by  \"mt\": \"4,0,4\" ,          Video: GTX 1080 Mining ETH Hash Rate almost 40MH/S without pill + settings      subscribe   Does not work?   Run --revA Command with the Tool.   Some GTX 1080s don’t run well with the default tool, so they could attempt to use this command. This is also found on the ethlargement’s prescription:   Windows: OhGodAnETHlargementPill.exe --revA 0,3,4   Powershell: .\\OhGodAnETHlargementPill.exe --revA 0,3,4   Linux: ./OhGodAnETHlargementPill --revA 0,3,4   You may have noticed the numbers after --revA. These values are the gpu slots, and they are a requirement to run the program properly. For instance, if your mining rig is composed solely of GTX 1080s and you have 3 cards, it would be --revA 0,1,2.   Also, if you’re wondering how to do this for Windows, you have to use the command line and change directories or folders into the exact location of the ethlargement program before copy and pasting that command in. To know it works, it should pop up the program.   Note! Some GPUs will perform better if you run Ethlargement after your mining program start hashing away.   What GPUs does the tablet work for?   As mentioned above, the tablet only works with GDDR5X memory.

Alternatives      ATI Winflash   Программа Flashrom   Radeon BIOS Editor (Due to the digital signature requirement on the latest AMD cards, RBE is no longer in active development and will not support the latest graphics cards.   Overview of program features   The utility is freely available free of charge. Supported on Windows XP and higher, up to the latest, tenth.   The utility has two modes of operation: through the command line (CMD) and the graphical shell (GUI). You can use any of the methods to update the BIOS. Before carrying out the procedure, be sure to download the BIOS of the required version for your device.   Do not turn off your computer while updating. Otherwise, a failure in the system will lead to the failure of the GPU. Also Atiflash DOS can keep the current firmware. If you run into problems with the new version of the software, it will help you roll back to the previous version.   The BIOS firmware should be changed for several reasons:      To increase the performance of the video card.   Change voltage parameters with power consumption.   To set up a system for mining cryptocurrency.   The software copes with each of the tasks.   The subtleties of the firmware through the graphical shell   Note that this method is only suitable if there are three GPUs in the system. Not more. Otherwise, the utility is not able to show all subsequent ones. Therefore, in this situation, it is worth using the command line. More about this above.   The video card must not only be displayed in Device Manager, but also fully functional. Otherwise, the AMD driver has blocked the custom BIOS.   If you have several identical AMD video cards in your system , then you need to specify the flashing of all video adapters with the same BIOS. Use the file where the modified BIOS is located (for example, BOIS_mod.rom). The command will look like this:   atiflash.exe-pa BIOS_mod_480.rom.   If you have two different GPUs in your system: R9390 and RX 5700, then run the utility with the key –i. View a list of all displayed graphics adapters. Remember the number of the required video adapter. In the command line, write:   Atiflash.exe -video adapter number   Suppose it has parameter 1. Then the command looks like this:   atiflash.exe –p 1 BOIS-mod_480.rom   Troubleshooting   Error 0fl01.        Freezing of the GPU or system when flashing BIOS. When updating the BIOS of the video adapter, you must disable it using the “Device Manager”. Also try restarting your computer.   After completing the BIOS update and restarting the PC, the graphics processor is detected, but does not work. There are manufacturer’s drivers that block the operation of the video adapter with an unsigned BIOS.   If you see the inscription: not found adapter - check the correct operation of the video card in the Device Manager.

Download for Windows / Linux        Download from SourceForge Download from Guru3d       What is OverdriveNTool?     OverdriveNTool - is a program for configuring the parameters of AMD graphics cards. The application changes the frequency indicators of the video card. In addition, the user has the ability to control the voltage. It can also be programmed to reduce the voltage consumption when the set temperature is reached. This reduces the risk of equipment overheating.     Supported video cards:          290, 290x, 380, 380x, 390, 390x, Fury, Fury X, Nano, 4xx, 5xx series  (RX 580, RX 570), Vega 56, Vega 64.        Requirements          OS: Windows 7,8,10 and later builds.   Graphics card: currently supported 290, 290x, 380, 380x, 390, 390x, Fury, Fury X, Nano, 4xx, 5xx series, Vega 56, Vega 64).

It’s on the right side of the utility (mV).        The essence of the selection of indicators is quite simple. Take the voltage from the lower category, for example 900 mV.   For example, you can get stability in the operation of the GPU with a frequency of 1153 MHz, when the voltage is 906 mV. In reality, the GPU operates with 2 voltage categories less. However, stability cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, each time it is necessary to carry out individual testing.   In other words, it is necessary to take the voltage from the lower stage, and the frequency from the upper one minus one.        The required indicators are entered into the utility and saved. During the initial creation, the system will recommend creating a file with a profile. In all the following settings for each video card or new profile, you will have to create a separate data file yourself. To do this, use the icon New.   By launching the utility and clicking on the menu that opens, the data of all video cards in the system are shown. Even those that are not supported by the utility are shown. If you select it, the program will warn you as a message This GPU is not supported, that is, this GPU is not supported. To work with such cards, you need MSI Afterburner along with a special BIOS firmware for the video adapter.    \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tTutorial Mining Ethereum from Zero: PhoenixMiner, ModBios, Overdriventool: \t \t \t \t subscribe \t    Fan control settings   In the settings, the required cooler speed indicators are additionally set. For the minimum, it is optimal to set 50-60% of the maximum allowable value.        The desired and maximum allowable temperature is also indicated. Electricity consumption is limited.   Zero RPM metric provides quiet operation with low GPU load and is enabled by default. The fans should spin up when the GPU is under load and the temperature rises. Zero RPMs are automatically disabled if any changes are made to Radeon ™ WattMan.   How to find power target values   Leave it zero % to draw normal TDP values. Set negative % to lower power draw. most people use -10 to -30 with stock BIOS. Max temp is when it will start to throttle speeds.   Power target actually an offset percentage so theoretically if you were to input 70 you would actually be telling the program you want a max power draw of ~240 Watts.   Profiles   By clicking the save button, the system automatically creates a file with the extension .ini, which indicates the entered overclocking values ​​and the rest of the graphics processor settings. To view all profiles, you need to expand the list of the corresponding name. To edit the settings, just run it .ini through a text editor or Word.   Downloading and checking the functioning of the selected profile will not take much time. Select it and click Load.        You can study the factory settings only after pressing the Reset button.      The file that allows you to run the utility automatically has the extension .bat. It is not there by default. You need to create it yourself.   A file with profiles, where overclocking settings, voltage drop, cooler speed and temperature indicators are recorded ( overdriventool.ini appears automatically when at least some profile is saved).        Startup   For the program to start automatically, a .bat file is created with the following content:   @echo Overdrive downvolt setting up  @echo off  timeout 15  OverdriveNTool.exe -p0\"0\" -p1\"1\" -p2\"2\" -p4\"4\" -p5\"5\"      -p from zero to 5 are the numbers of the GPUs;   the values ​​in quotation marks \"\" 0 through 5 are the names of the profiles applied to these video cards.   The shortcut to this file can be placed in startup -    C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup    Replace Username  with the system username. This folder is located on your hard drive C.          Video: OverDriveNTool autoload     subscribe   How to reset   To restore the work of the graphics processor when there were failures, in the old version of the utility it was required to add a command to the batch file –r. This made it possible to reset the settings of the video card to those set by the manufacturer. It looks like this:   -r5   Here 5 means the number of the video adapter.   After the release of 0.2.7, the restart is performed in automatic mode until the required parameters are set. The .bat file for autorun in the old version looks like this:   @echo Overdrive downvolt setting up  @echo off  timeout 15  OverdriveNTool.exe -r0 -r1 -r2 -r3 -r4 -r5  timeout 15  OverdriveNTool.exe -p0\"0\" -p1\"1\" -p2\"2\" -p4\"4\" -p5\"5\"   The timeout indicator is set individually. It depends on how quickly the system boots. For a hard disk, the time is about 30-50 seconds, while for an SSD, 5-20 seconds are enough. If the timeout time is too short, then the batch file settings will not be applied. Then an error. Therefore, do not rush to save a second for the optimal regime. After all, this way you can mess up all the settings of the GPU.   Example ini file for RX 580   [Profile_rx580]  Name=0  GPU_P0=300;750  GPU_P1=466;818;0  GPU_P2=751;824;0  GPU_P3=1019;830;0  GPU_P4=1074;840;0  GPU_P5=1090;840;0  GPU_P6=1110;840;0  GPU_P7=1160;840  Mem_P0=300;750  Mem_P1=1000;800  Mem_P2=1950;860  Fan_Min=1500  Fan_Max=2280  Fan_Target=75  Fan_Acoustic=1411  Power_Temp=85  Power_Target=0   5700 and  5700 xt          Video guide: Which Overclocking Software To Use For Mining In Windows?     subscribe   This is how I decided to reset the voltage on for my 5700 and 5700 xt.   I created a script for my mining farm, in which, after restarting Windows, OverdriveNTool will disable / enable my cards before launching the software for miners (since they are known to sometimes reset after a crash, and this leads, for example, to too much power consumption)…   However, some cards did not give up and reset the voltage to some random number after pressing the “Apply” button. I found out that the new driver is to blame. So, I found a combination that works for me:      Version - OverdriveNTool 0.2.9.0   Driver - win10-radeon-software-adrenalin-2020-edition-20.4.2-apr23   When I installed the older 20.4.2 driver and also disabled Windows Updates, “AMD Crash Defender Service” and “AMD External Events Utility” via services.msc, I can finally use my .bat script to automatically overclock and start the miner without any problems after Windows crash.   I just noticed that I can no longer run the Adrenaline driver as it says my drivers and AMD software are not the same. Maybe it’s because my AMD reinstall was not completely clean as I didn’t delete the old AMD directory, but who cares, I don’t need it anymore.   Alternatives   Is there a version for Nvidia? No, there are alternatives. For example:      Nvidia Inspector   MSI Afterburner   ATI Winflash   Polaris Bios Editor          Beginners guide: Rx Vega 64 Ethereum mining Part 1:     subscribe   Use without a profile   It is easy to use the program without a profile file. To do this, you need to specify in the batch file all the values ​​for the subsequent overclocking of the graphics processor. For this, the following line fits:   -ac[gpu_id] GPU_P[num]=[value];[value][;0] Mem_P[num]=[value];[value][;0] Fan_Min=[value] Fan_Max=[value] Fan_Target=[value] Fan_Acoustic=[value] Power_Temp=[value] Power_Target=[value]   -ас installed with the key –р. All the indicators that were written further are applied, without applying the profiles from the .ini file.   If the indicators are value not registered, then the system will automatically ignore them.   In this situation, you need to specify the required indicator number pstate(num). In this case, the first is value indicated as the core frequency. The second value displays voltage. Note that the unit of measurement here is millivolts.   On a line, [;0] indicates the indicator is disabled Pstate.   If you specify the * frequency or voltage of video memory or core, the utility will ignore this indicator.   The timing level parameter optimizes memory latency settings to unlock some additional performance on certain (non-gaming) workloads.   In Linux, you can change the P-state values ​​for the kernel and VRAM in the same way as overclocking in Windows using OverdriveNTool. To manually change the overclocking parameters, you must first run the command:   sudo echo \"manual\"&gt; / sys / class / drm / card0 / device / power_dpm_force_performance_level   Command line parameters   [gpu_id] - it’s the first number taken from GPU description, for single video card it’s 0 \"Name\" - name of the profile that was saved ealier, must be quoted if has spaces inside   example:  OverdriveNTool.exe -p0myProfile -p1\"Profile 2\"      -p[gpu_id]\"Name\" - apply profile \"Name\" to GPU with id=[gpu_id]   -c[gpu_id]\"Name\" - same as above, but with confirmation message that application started and everything went ok.   -r[gpu_id] - reset GPU with id=[gpu_id]   cp[gpu_id]\"Name\" - compare current values of GPU with id=[gpu_id] with profile \"Name\", and eventually set this profile if not equal   cm[gpu_id]\"Name\" - compare current values of GPU with id=[gpu_id] with profile \"Name\", and eventually set this profile if not equal, with additional message if not equal found   co[gpu_id]\"Name\" - only compare current values of GPU with id=[gpu_id] with profile \"Name\", with message if not equal found   -consoleonly  - displays all messages (eg. errors) in cmd.exe console window, instead of gui messages. Only commands that are put after -consoleonly are affected, example:     \"OverdriveNTool.exe\" -consoleonly -r0 -p0\"1\" -r1 -p1\"1\" -r2 -p2\"2\" - will affect all commands \"OverdriveNTool.exe\" -r0 -p0\"1\" -r1 -consoleonly -p1\"1\" -r2 -p2\"2\" - will affect -p1\"1\" -r2 -p2\"2\" commands only           -showgui - when added to commandline normal GUI will be displayed after program finishes with all other commands.   -wait[miliseconds] - program waits specified time before parsing next command, useful if you want to add some delay for example on windows startup, can be used multiple times in one commandline.    example:   OverdriveNTool.exe -wait3000 -r0 -wait500 -p0profile1   In this example application starts without gui, then sets \"myProfile\" to GPU with id=0 and \"Profile 2\" to GPU with id=1 and then exit.   commands can be used all together, for example:   OverdriveNTool.exe -p0myProfile -r0 co1\"Profile 1\"   On configs with more than 10 GPUs [gpu_id] must have 2 digits, for GPUs 0-9 leading 0 must be added, example:   00,01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,09,10,11,12. Usage example: -p05\"Name\"   It’s possible to use * as [gpu_id], which means it affects all supported GPUs, example:   -r* -p*MyProfile -p2\"Custom profile\" cm*MyProfile   Advanced:   -ac[gpu_id] GPU_P[num]=[value];[value][;0] Mem_P[num]=[value];[value][;0] Fan_Min=[value] Fan_Max=[value] Fan_Target=[value] Fan_Acoustic=[value] Power_Temp=[value] Power_Target=[value]   -ac is similar to -p command, applies values but without using profiles. Format is identical to ini profile. All not specified values will remain untouched. Can be used with other commands (-consoleonly, * as [gpu_id], -r, -p… etc.)   [num] - Pstate number, using # as [num] will apply to highest available Pstate for scpecified GPU [value] – value, for GPU and memory PState first value is clock (MHz), second is voltage (mV), third optional ;0 makes this Pstate disabled.   Putting * as Memory or GPU value will skip applying this value, for example: -ac0 GPU_P7=*;800 Mem_P3=1000;* (only applies GPU_P7 voltage=800mV and Memory P3 clock=1000MHZ) -ac0 GPU_P4=*;*;0 (only disables GPU_P4 without changing it’s values)   For I2C settings use –ac with Offset=[value] LLC=[value] PhaseGain=[value] CurrentScale=[value]   I2C must be enabled and supported for specified GPU, otherwise it will not work. Offset value is multiplied by 6,25mV, so 10 = +62,5mV, -5 = -31,25mV   Example:  -ac0 Offset=10 LLC=0 -ac0 Offset=-5 LLC=1 PhaseGain=000000 CurrentScale=60   Commands example:   -ac0 GPU_P7=1200;800 Mem_P2=1000;850 Fan_Min=1080 Fan_Max=1700 Fan_Target=70 Fan_Acoustic=700 Power_Temp=90 Power_Target=50 -ac1 GPU_P#=1200;800 Mem_P#=1000;850   -ac0 GPU_P7=1200;800;0 Mem_P3=1000;850 Fan_Min=1080 Fan_Max=1700   -consoleonly -r5 -ac5 GPU_P#=1200;800 Mem_P#=1000;850 Fan_Min=1080 Fan_Max=1700 -ac4 Fan_Target=70 Fan_Acoustic=700 Power_Temp=90 Power_Target=50   -ac* Power_Target=-1 GPU_P7=*;*;0   -wait1000 -r0 -ac0 GPU_P7=1200;800 Mem_P1=700;850;0 Mem_P2=750;850;0 Mem_P3=800;850;0 Mem_P4=1000;850 Fan_Min=1080 Fan_Max=1700 Fan_Target=70 Fan_Acoustic=700 Power_Temp=90 Power_Target=50  ```batch -ac0 Power_Target=50 -ac1 Power_Target=-50 -ac2 Fan_Max=1700 Fan_Min=1080 -ac1 Fan_Acoustic=700   -getcurrent - prints current values for all supported GPUs in cmd console window.   -t[gpu_id]   restart GPU with id=[gpu_id]. It’s similar to devices manager enable/disable GPU. Useful for immediately apply registry changes done to AMD keys like SoftPowerPlay table. It requires admin rigths to work.   Troubleshooting   Driver is detected as not installed / loaded - The program has detected an incompatible driver. Make sure you have selected the AMD graphics card in the upper field of the program.   If the program says: “gpu not supported” - try to remove the drivers completely through the display deiver unistaller and stop them.      Work around the bug in the driver 17.7.2. which appears when using the default voltage instead of the programmed ones. If it occurs, reset everything and reapply the profile.   Can be off / on. any state P. Here you need to click on P0, P1, etc. If this state is disabled, then the video card will not use it.   I2C can currently support IR3567B. This includes the RX470-480 series, as well as individual RX5xx. Also there is support for up   If you don’t want to change the cooler settings. Then disable this section in all video cards. This can be done as follows: press CLTR + double-click in the cooler window. It will be saved according to the video card ID. Due to this, the graphical interface or commands will not be able to affect the configuration of the cooler for the installed video card.   To open the settings or the SoftPowerPlayTable editor, double-click the program icon. It is located at the top left. You can also right-click on a title.   To change the “friendly name”, you need to enable it in the settings. Then press RMB on the list of video cards to open the menu.   Old versions   0.2.9 (14.06.2020)     fixed: Application recognizes driver not installed in 20.5.1 (or newer)   added profiles with reordering   0.2.8 (04.16.2019)  support for fan curve and memory sync level introduced in driver 18.12.2 (removed min, max fan, target fan temp and power temp) * added command -wait     added the ability to apply or reset all supported GPUs at once using Ctrl + Apply or Ctrl + Reset fixed a bug with duplicating graphics processors and profiles when using the command -showgui   Conclusions   This utility is hosted on the official resource at SourceForge, not on GitHub. There is also a discussion thread at techpowerup.   Despite the fact that the program is released only in English, it will be understood by anyone who has worked with utilities designed to overclock GPUs before.   For effective mining, you need to use the capabilities of the video card at full capacity. It is quite simple to work with the program.  ","categories": ["tools"],

WattTool - used to reduce power consumption and overlocking video cards from AMD. The program is suitable exclusively for miners. It is able to change the voltage and frequency control of the video adapters. The utility is especially popular for the RX line, both 480 and 580.

This is done so that the video card does not overheat and meets the declared service life. However, this is extremely inconvenient for miners. They need to increase the power of their graphics hardware. If you have such a problem and you are the owner of an AMD card, we recommend that you pay attention to this program.   Attention!  Vega graphics cards and many others are not supported. To work with such cards, you need MSI Afterburner along with a special BIOS firmware for the video adapter.          Video: Gigabyte rx 480 g1 8gb is cool! Literally [f8 bios]     subscribe   The program is used to monitor the state of graphics processors, adjust the voltage and speed of coolers. The utility allows you to reduce power consumption, power supply load. An ordinary user does not need such functionality. However, it will come in very handy for farm owners. Reducing power consumption will allow you to earn more, reducing the payback period and increasing the duration of the graphics adapters.   The program can also be suitable for those who need to increase the performance of video adapters. Using the client, you can overclock the graphics card by setting the optimal frequency of the video memory and core. In addition, the utility is worth downloading for the sake of increasing the rotational speed of the fan blades. This process is mandatory, since overclocking a video card necessarily leads to increased heating, which ultimately will cause the graphics card to burn out. By default, the utility sets the limit to 90˚C. If necessary, the indicator can be changed. However, this can be done only by realizing the risks of a quick failure of the graphics card.   Alternatives  Is there a version for Nvidia? No, there are alternatives. For example:      Nvidia Inspector   MSI Afterburner   ATI Winflash   Polaris Bios Editor   Features:      Tracking and configuring VRM.   Maintaining profiles.   Changing clock frequencies and voltages.   Changing the voltage of the video memory.   Cooler and power settings.   Standard monitoring with no performance impact.   Access to I2C is provided.   Load line correction.   The ability to scale the current energy consumption.   Voltage variation in the range of -300 … + 300 mV.   Profiles can be passed as arguments via the command line. They can also be loaded and saved through the graphical interface. * For each processor, you can add its own, individually configured profile. Data is entered through the command line.          Video: How to overclock and undervolt rx 580 - adrenalin 2020 easy guide, tutorial:     subscribe   Commands      GPU clock and voltage: works similar to WattMan. Clocks are not restricted to 5 MHz increments, but voltage is limited to 6.25 mV steps (rounding mode is up, so 976 mV will result in 981.25 mV).   Memory clock and voltage: works similar to WattMan. The voltage is not the actual memory voltage (which is fixed to about 1.5 V or needs a hardmod)). The voltage controllers second loop is not used, so it is questionable, whether the memory controller has an own dynamic voltage plane. My guess is that the voltage set here simply is a lower limit for the core voltage. If you overclock the memory, always check for memory errors (can be done with HWiNFO).   Fan and Power settings: nothing special here. Minimum fan rpm is not limited, I can set values below WattMan’s limit of 1040 rpm. Minimum rpm is not used directly. My estimate is that values below 2200 are scaled by 2/3. So 2500 results in 2200 * 2/3 + 300 = 1760 (see screenshot), while 1800 will give 1800 * 2/3 = 1200.   Standard monitoring: these values should be identical to the values displayed in WattMan and there is (almost) no performance impact caused by monitoring.   I2C access: is currently only working for the IR3567B controller on line 4 address 8 on RX470/RX480 cards. Access is synchronized with other tools like GPU-Z or HWiNFO, which can sometimes result in missing readings. I2C access has a large performance impact and causes stuttering (even for dragging a window on the desktop). Changes to I2C settings are not persistent. They will revert to defaults after the VRM is powered down.   VRM monitoring: is disabled by default. Reading the values is not atomic, so VID and VOUT are not always in sync. VDDC resolution is only 7.8 mV.   Load Line Calibration: eliminates voltage drop (on my card i get VOUT = VID +- 1mV). Not actually very useful.   Phase gain: The reference RX 480 has the first three VRM phases connected to the 6-pin connector and the remaining three phases connected to the slot. After reviews measured power draw above 80 W from the slots, AMD implemented a fix that shifts load the 6-pin connector. The default value for this is DDD000 (Hex). The maximum possible shift would be FFF000. Equal load distribution (000000) slightly increases the VRM efficiency. I get about 3°C lower VRM temps with 000000, power savings might be in the 2-3W range. On non-reference cards all/most phases are probably connected to the 8-pin, so changing this setting is pointless.   Current scale: will scale the current reported by the VRM. On the reference RX480 the default value is 60 (hex). If you set it to 20 you will see GPU-Z reporting about half the power draw. This will double the available power, before you reach the power target. But other stuff will also only see half the current. Dont expect over current protection to work with this setting. The encoding of this value is unknown and non-reference cards use different values. If you want to bypass the power limit, it is probably safer to use EMBD or a custom bios (der8auer’s unlocked air bios for reference cards is signed by AMD).   Voltage offset: is available from -300mV to +300mV (not tested over the whole range). The input is decimal and gets multiplied by 6.25mV. So the valid range is -48 to 48.   Troubleshooting   If you find the error “Mutex creation failed”, run the program as administrator. The problem appears when there is a working program that monitors GPUs, for example GPU-Z. In this case, the utility is already acting on behalf of the administrator. Therefore, there are mutual synchronization exceptions. To fix the problem, you need to download and run Wattul as a regular user. Next, you need to close all programs in use, and then restart the utility.   Versions      0.91   0.9   Conclusions   We have identified the following features of the program:      The operating frequencies of both the video memory and the core of AMD graphics cards are being adjusted.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up and use the latest BTC Tools v1.3.3 and newer.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download from bitmain.com Download (Linux)       What are BTC Tools?     BTC Tools - is a tool for scanning, configuring, rebooting and updating most Antminer, WhatsMiner, Innosilicon or Avalon ASICs. The utility includes ip scanner, monitoring, batch control overclocking miners. Using this software you can easily find abnormal miners with low hash rate or high temperature.     The application allows for simple configuration, reboot, upgrade, performance tuning and/or power reduction. The tool is useful when working with multiple miners. For example, if you want to reboot all or a small part of the devices, you can do it using BTC Tools by selecting each of them and clicking the \"Restart\" button.          How to use BTC Tools?  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the software  \t\t \t\t \t\tDownload the program from the official source - the bitmain website. \t\t   \t\t  \t\tExtract the archive with the program. Double click on the file BTCTools-v1.3.1.exe.   \t\t \t\t \t  \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Run the scanner  \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\tThe utility will automatically import the current range of IP addresses. If the IP range is correct, you can click the \"Scan\" button to start scanning the miners. You will have to wait until the scan is complete. \t\t    \t\tIf the IP range is not correct, then double-click on the area with the ip address and add the required address ranges.  When the program finds a miner, it will display basic information (including IP, miner type, hash rate, temperature, fan speed, elapsed time, pools and worker names) in a table.       By default, the utility displays information only about successfully identified miners. If you want to display information about each scanned IP address, uncheck the \"Only Success Miners\" checkbox.  The software will display all the enabled miners on the network, then it remains to select the desired ip address and enter it into the address bar of the browser or double-click on the desired device and its web interface will open in the browser.  Each column in the table can be sorted. Click a column heading - you can sort it in ascending order. Click again and sort in descending order. (Temperature is sorted by the maximum of several values, and fan speed is sorted by average.)  If you see a highlighted (red) item in the table, it means that the miner's value is out of the normal range.        \t\t \t\t \t   \t \t \t \tStep 3 - make the settings  \t \t   If you want to change the pool of one or all devices, just enter the address of the pool, the name of the additional account (the ending \".\" Can be omitted, the program will automatically add it for you) and the password (can be left blank). Select the postfix type for the worker name. Then click the \"Config Selected Miners\" or \"Config All Miners\" button.       When using the “Config Selected Miners” function, you need to select ASIC. Click any cell in the miners table, then the cell will turn blue - you have selected the miner of its row (you only need to select a cell, you do not need to select the entire row). You can drag your mouse to select multiple consecutive miners. Or, hold down the Ctrl key and click multiple individual lines. Another way to select multiple consecutive miners is to click the start miner, hold down the Shift key, then click the end miner.  If you need to restart the devices, click the \"Reboot Selected Miners\" or \"Reboot All Miners\" button. Currently, the program can only restart Antminers, Avalon restart is in development.     \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo instruction  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Does the software not see the ASIC?   In such cases, resetting the settings on the miner and scanning helps 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.1.255. Well, your own subnet must also be within these limits. DHCP can be active on the router and it will issue a “ranodom” ip to the miner itself.   Also execute on the command line arp -a and you will see all the addresses on the local network. If you know the MAC address of the ASIC, then it’s great, if you don’t know, then go through all the addresses in turn, those at the top of the list have MAC.

Typically, users can use the following methods to determine the miner’s IP address:   Log into the router your miners are connecting to (suitable for multiple miners)   Enter the IP address of the router into the address bar of your browser, and then you will see the login page. Make sure your computer is also connected to this router. Click “connected terminals”, then you will see all the equipment that connects to this router. Typically, ASICs with Antminer will display the name with “Antminer”. The list contains the IP address of each terminal. Copy the URL into the address bar.        Note!  In some routers, this setting is called “DHCP” rather than “Device list”.   Use IP Scanner to scan IP (suitable for multiple miners)   If users do not know the IP address of the router, you can download an IP scanner to find out the IP address of the miner.      Connect your computer and miners to the same router.   Press Windows+R together and enter cmd, then enter ipconfig/all and press Enter.   IPv4 address is the IP address of your computer. For example, the IP address of your computer 192.168.1.146.   Download IP scanner, enter 192.168.1.0-254 and click search to start scanning. When scanning is complete, a page as shown below will appear. Usually there are some columns, like name, IP, producer, MACand you can determine which device is a miner named. But there are also some miners who do not represent a name, but only an IP, for example 192.168.1.90.        Use IP Reporter to get an IP address (suitable for both multiple miners and many. Usually Antminer miners have this button)           Download the IP reporter software;   Run the program on your computer and click “start”;   Keep the button pressed for one second;   Your computer will receive the miner’s IP address as shown below.

The architecture 52 with a multiprocessor is used SMX 13. The data varies depending on the video card or processor model. They display the settings for the video adapter.   To get optimal performance, you need to experimentally adjust them. For example, if the PC freezes while mining a token, then reduce the amount of threads used and bfactor. For each individual video card in the farm, you can write data separated by commas. In this case, an index is indicated, which is the identifier of the system used.          Video: CPU Mining Performance Boost - XMRig Tweaks - Followup to Previous Video     subscribe   Xmrig proxy setup   Xmrig-proxy (miner proxy pool) is an additional transmission channel between miners and pools. Xmrig-proxy not only takes on the role of the mining pool, but also takes on the responsibility of the miner. Xmrig-proxy receives tasks from the pool and then assigns them to miners to perform computations (in this sense, it takes on the role of the mining pool).   After the calculation is complete, the miners send the shares to xmrig-proxy, then xmrig-proxy send the data to the mining pool.        So, under what circumstances should xmrig-proxy be used?      Miners with a large number of devices can use xmrig-proxy to centrally manage computing power.   When there are many miners connected to a specific IP address that send shares (solutions) too often, the pool will consider this as a DDoS attack and that IP address will be blocked by the mining pool. At this time, you can install a proxy.   The mining pool is far away and an agent has been added to improve network connectivity.   Xmrig-proxy usage guide:      Download the XMRig Proxy version and unzip it.        After unpacking, you will see two files: xmrig-proxy.exe and config.json (there will also be minor files: SHA256SUMS and start.bat).         Right click to edit the file. Notepad++ editor to edit     The mining port can be used by default, if you have special needs, you can change it yourself. After modification, save and exit.       Double click xmrig-proxy to start it and start the proxy pool service. Look at the interface as in the following figure, it means your agent has been started successfully. You may need to allow it to run. Click “Allow access”.      After successfully launching Xmrig-proxy, we need to change the address of the mining pool IP:PORT to where the xmrig-proxy is located. The rest do not need to be changed.      Change the parameter \"url\": to your IP:        Then run xmrig like below:        You will see all the miners on the network:        How to check hashrate   In the XMrig proxy miner, you can check the hash rate, results and status of video cards. There are two ways to view the data:      Through the console.   via API.   By default, the hash rate is displayed every minute. You can use the command --print-time to change this indicator.        In the miner window, you need to press the following keys:   H - to display the hashrate value. E - to show the performance of the graphics adapter. P - to press pause. R - to resume work.      H – to display the hashrate value.   E – to show the performance of the graphics adapter.   P – to press pause..   R – to resume work.   If the program sends shares to the pool, an alert is shown accepted. In case of problems with the configuration, the system issues rejected.   MSR Mod   MSR Mod – is hardware prefetching to solve fundamental performance problems. RandomX’s algorithm accesses memory randomly, so prefetching just doesn’t work.   Sometimes prefetching can be turned off in BIOS. For Intel, this is usually setting Hardware Prefetcher and adjoining Cache Line Prefetch. However, some MSRs cannot be disabled even in the BIOS. In all the places where prefetching can help, there are already explicit prefetch instructions in your code.   The solution is to set up prefetching using MSRs at the OS level.   If you are running the latest version of XMRig with root (Linux) or Administrator (Windows) rights, the miner automatically configures all MSR registers. If everything is in order, the miner has received all the necessary privileges and your processor supports them, you will see a line as shown below in the miner’s log.   msr register values for \"intel\" preset has been set successfully (16 ms)   Some hardware / software configurations also need to be disabled Secure Boot for the MSR mod to work, check issue #1891 on github.   Supported processors:      Intel (Nehalem, Westmere, Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Broadwell and newer).   Ryzen (all Zen-based processors: Ryzen, Threadripper, EPYC).   XMRig restores the original MSR values ​​by default on exit, in any case the changes are not saved, restarting the computer will always discard any changes.   Performance tuning   There “randomx” are 2 options available for configuration in an object:      \"rdmsr\"   \"wrmsr\"   Option rdmsr:  Use \"rdmsr\": false to disable initial MSR recovery on exit.   Option WRMSR:  \"wrmsr\": true (default) Enable the feature MSRor. Use \"wrmsr\": false to disable the MSR feature.   WRMSR number:  \"wrmsr\": 15 Available for Intel only. The default 15 for Intel is generally good, but may not be better, see discussion № 1433 on github.   WRMSR array:  A very advanced format for fine tuning. Use with care. Preset values ​​supplied with the miner:      \"wrmsr\": [\"0x1a4:0xf\"] Intel preset.   \"wrmsr\": [\"0xc0011020:0x4480000000000\", \"0xc0011021:0x1c000200000040:0xffffffffffffffdf\", \"0xc0011022:0xc000000401500000\", \"0xc001102b:0x2000cc14\"] AMD Ryzen (Zen3).   \"wrmsr\": [\"0xc0011020:0x0\", \"0xc0011021:0x40:0xffffffffffffffdf\", \"0xc0011022:0x1510000\", \"0xc001102b:0x2000cc16\"] AMD Ryzen (Zen1/Zen2).   \"wrmsr\": [\"0xc0011020:0x0\", \"0xc0011021:0x60\", \"0xc0011022:0x510000\", \"0xc001102b:0x1808cc16\"] Special configurable value for first generation Zen processors (with known hardware error) to disable opcache and enable MSR mod.   Also, the performance is greatly improved by the parameter “huge pages”.   Watch the video:          Video: Mine faster on CPUs - A guide to help you CPU mine faster!     subscribe   The CPU Affinity.  parameter also increases the performance.   CPU Affinity is software binding (binding) to processor cores of specific computing processes.   An example of a command in a batch file:   --cpu-affinity 0x155   Use the online calculator to find the CPU Affinity values for your processor.

Has high performance.   The miner officially supports Windows.   Supports the RandomX algorithm, which was adopted by the popular digital coin Monero.   The program also works with NiceHash service.   Apart from RandomX, the software also runs on CryptoNight.   The program uses the CUDA plugin for the miner. Used in separate versions of the program. It is optional and therefore not included in the main software. Moreover, this technology is demanding on the compiler version, and therefore conflicts often arise with the processor code.   Doesn’t work?   The efficiency of mining digital tokens depends on the correct setting of the miner. If you enter the parameters incorrectly, then the program simply will not start or generate an error. However, when using the advanced configuration: adjusting the parameters of the video card, core frequency, etc., then there is a risk of faster wear of the equipment.

XMRig is not malware. This is a legal cryptocurrency mining program.   However, many malware creators and operators of large botnets embed xmrig-cuda.dll in their malware in order to use other people’s computers to mine cryptocurrency without their permission. This is why antivirus software treats XMRig as malware due to the large number of computers infected with malware associated with it.   Total:      If you downloaded the program yourself from the official source on Github or xmrig.com, then there is nothing to worry about.   If you have never downloaded this program yourself, uninstall it immediately.   Therefore, some antivirus scanners consider the program to be malicious because antiviruses do not distinguish between intentional (conscious) mining and hidden mining (when cryptocurrency is mined without your knowledge). In the latter case, you need to remove the program from the system.   How to remove?   If the virus has recently begun to act, then go to the system folder and look at the date the files were modified, you will find. Manually deleted like this: Shift + Delete.   If you downloaded the program yourself, then just delete it as you usually delete files.

If you still need help we have a detailed guide to help you with all the steps.   Frequent problems   Users from time to time may have various problems with the miner. Some are associated with drivers, others with the peculiarities of the algorithm.   For example, an error with the algorithm looks like this wrong algo, use randomx miner. It occurs when the wrong syntax of the algorithm is entered or it was not possible to change it. Also, the problem may appear due to strong overclocking of the video card.   The problem low difficulty share speaks of an incorrectly matched pool port. Assignments come with erroneous difficulty. Choose a pool based on your hardware. Please note that for a farm with high-performance cards, medium-performance processors, and just one card or home computer, different port categories are issued.   The error cryptonight_extra_cpu_finak indicates a system overload. Therefore, you need to reduce the size of streams and blocks.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up and use the latest MorePowerTool v1.3.18 and newer.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download from igor´sLAB Download from igor´sLAB 2       What is MorePowerTool?     MorePowerTool - is a utility designed to help you squeeze out as much performance as possible while overclocking your graphics card. MorePowerTool is unofficial overclocking software not authorized by AMD. This means that you use it at your own risk.    Supported GPUs:   Currently, MPT works with all released Navi maps, with the SPPT (SoftPowerPlayTables) in the registry extremely slowing down or artificially restricting the drivers. The current version of RBE (Red BIOS Editor) allows writing all MPT modifications directly to the BIOS of the RX 5700, 5700 XT (X) and RX 5600 XT and saving this BIOS as a flashable file. However, at present, only the only adapted version of the ATI Flash Tool allows flashing the BIOS created in this way in the RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT (X).        How to Use MorePowerTool?  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the program  \t\t \t\t \t\tDownload the program from the official source - igorslab.de. \t\t   \t\t  \t\tInstall the program following the standard instructions.

Save the current BIOS as described in the ATIFlash instructions.         Or save the BIOS .rom file in the TechPowerUp GPU-Z.        Alternatively: use other programs like ATITool and RivaTuner, they can also save BIOS from the card. However, these programs still have problems with the latest graphics cards.   \t\t \t\t \t   \t \t \t \tStep 3 - optimize for mining  \t \t Run MorePowerTool.exe as administrator. To do this, right-click.      Click the \"Load\" button and load the BIOS version you saved in the previous step. In the selection window, select the BIOS file with the extension .rom. You can also open any other BIOS found on the Internet.      In the field above, select your GPU.      Now we set the \"Overdrive Limits\". This influences the specifications of the sliders and their maximum values in the Wattman.      Next we set the \"Power and Voltage\". This also influences the specifications of the the maximum values in the Wattman for the Frequency/Voltage slider and the Power Limit. The \"Current\" setting TDCI can be set only here, not in Wattman!      Next we set the \"Frequencies\". This also influences the specifications of the values in the Wattman for the combined Frequency/Voltage slider and the memory clock rate as real preset.      Finally, we can change the fan curves necessary. But much more important is the saving with \"Save\" into the MPT settings file with the changed PowerPlayTables. Don't use \"Write SPPT\" or \"Delete SPPT\"!      We reload the saved BIOS, because this serves as template for the new BIOS. To do this, we use a bunch of programs: Red Bios Editor (RBE) + MorePowerTool.  Run Red BIOS Editor.exe. Open the BIOS with the \"Load\" button. Want to display a new boot message? Why not personalize it? Change sub-vendor and GPU ID!      Now we can load the saved PowerPlayTables from the MorePowerTool into the new BIOS.      The new VRAM settings are more tricky. Only change something here if you are really sure what you are doing! Besides the timing strings you can also select other modules (manufacturer). But be careful as always!      We can now save our new BIOS into an own ROM file!      Now we need to flash the BIOS Back to the card!  We need an adapted Flash tool. Follow the instructions for ATIFlash firmware.   If you increased the settings carefully, you don't need any further overclocking. But if you need more power, let's have a look at the Wattman!    Higher GFX clock rate. More GFX voltage.

Because AMD has closed the door for increasing the power limit and voltage specifications in Wattman, you have to ultimately set the TGP and the TDC in MPT, i.e. the maximum power for the GPU and memory along with the maximum upper limit for the flowing currents. Here you should act very carefully, as long as you can’t estimate in detail yourself and know how the board really reacts.

The application can be used for both GPU and FPGA, ASIC, etc.    Supported cryptocurrencies:   The app works for cryptocurrencies like ETH, ETC, XMR, ZCash, etc.   DevFeeCut - is a simple program to disable DevFee when used in conjunction with PhoenixMiner.   Attention!  We strongly DO NOT recommend using NoDevFee or DevFeeCut because these programs are not tested. And also because the NoDevFee search function is implemented in actual mining software.  In this case, these programs artificially underestimate the hash rate.   Attention!!!   Use this software at your own risk. Use only if you mine cryptocurrency on a separate PC.   But if you want to try and compare the results, then read the manual below.

Falcon's NoDevFee15.zip uses the Windivert packet capture driver. Miners like Claymore detect the use of this driver and slow down the mining speed, but do not show it. You can read about this in the readme:  Attempts to cheat and remove commissions. developers will cause a slightly slower mining speed (like \"-nofee 1\"), although the miner will show the same hash rate.               How can I check if the program is actually working?               Go to your own pool and search and look for a named worker eth1.0 after the program has been running for a while. Example:                            How to run NoDevFee in autostart before PhoenixMiner?              You can use the Startup Delayer software to launch the executable files in the correct order.                   What if the wallet address found is incorrect?              Make sure you run the file divert.exe before PhoenixMiner. In any case, restart the program and miner and open everything in the correct order.                    XMRig compilation guide with No Dev Fee. See xmrig compilation guide: steps to remove commission.     subscribe   Requirements      NET Framework 4.7.   This program uses WinDivert lib to intercept and modify TCP-packets so that they do not end up on the devfee wallet address. It will only work with ETH without SSL, because with SSL it will not intercept those packets.   WinDivert is a packet capturing library that allows you to intercept / modify / discard network packets sent to / from the Windows network stack.   Pool compatibility list:      Ethermine   Nanopool   Does not work?   The application works mainly with old versions of miners. You need to look for old versions of programs.   Conclusions   The utility works by returning DevFee to a different wallet address, which may be different from the main mining address.   If possible, use multiple miners for testing so you can get your money back for DevFee faster.   If you are mining on video cards, then it is recommended to use PhoenixMiner  ","categories": ["tools"],

First you need to create a wallet: Download Epic wallet from https://epic.tech/downloads A paper wallet for Verus can be created here : https://paperwallet.veruscoin.io   Go to miner folder and double click on guided-setup.bat The interactive configuration creator will start   Let`s see the questions and answers:     Coin name should be the name of the coin you are creating the configuration for. In this example it will be Epic+Verus   We want to use multi algorithm mining, so enter y   Epic + Verus are 2 algorithms, so enter 2   Algorithm for Epic Cash is randomepic. You need to type this without the quotes. (algorithm 0 name)   Address and port of mining pool is what we got from the pool`s site   Address of the wallet will be your username, so choose a unique one   Password can be anything, but make sure it`s not too simple because you will use it to withdraw your coins   Algorithm for VerusCoin is verushash. You need to type this without the quotes. (algorithm 1 name)   Address and port of mining pool is what we got from the pool`s site   Address of the wallet is the one you created with the paper wallet generator earlier   Password can be anything, so write x   Do you want to use your CPU for mining algorithm 1? Answer y   Logging can be useful when you have some issues and want to track them down. Let's set this to no n for now   Because verushash can be both CPU and GPU mined, miner will ask if we want to enable compute mode. Answer n     After the guided setup is finished, we still have two more steps to do. First one is to disable GPU mining, because we only want to use CPU mining.   Go to miner folder and edit the start_VerusCoin.bat file that was created with the help of the guided setup.   Add --disable-gpu parameter ( without the quotes ) and save file   Second one is to add --multi-algorithm-job-mode 3 because this tells miner to always mine algorithm 0, and only    mine algorithm 1 when algorithm 0 cant be mined. To make it simple, while there are no Epic Cash RandomX jobs,  SRBMiner will mine Verushash.   To learn about all SRBMiner parameters check the Help and Examples folders.     You can use this type of mining with any algorithm combination, both for CPU and GPU  Now all you have to do to start mining is double click start_VerusCoin.bat !   \t    \thttps://www.youtube.com/embed/OJdURgMdZRY \t \thttps://youtu.be/OJdURgMdZRY?t={seek_to_second_number}  &nbsp;    \tAuto tune for dual mining explained \t \t  Download SRBMiner-MULTI.   Unzip the archive somewhere.   We will go through the auto tune mode for dual mining in this video   Go into miner folder, there is already a start-mining-ethereum-and-kaspa example.    To enable the auto tuning mode you need to have --gpu-auto-tune 1 added to your parameters   Auto tune mode for dual mining searches for the best intensity value on the SECOND algorithm (KASPA/ALEPHIUM)   Returned intensity highly depends from CORE clock of the GPU    7.5 Wait until we reach the max hashrate average ... after that we are going to increase CORE to see what happens! Intensity was 4 for clock 1220, now on 1900 its 8!   Parameter --gpu-dual-max-loss can define how much % of hashrate loss we allow for the FIRST algorithm   Default, if not set, is 5%. Let's see what happens if we set it to 20% A1 (KASPA) intensity was 8, now it's 10! Because we allowed more to second algorithm.   Less hashrate on the FIRST algorithm (~80% of the maximum we would get without dual mining), but more hashrate on the SECOND algorithm    let`s wait a little bit to see the final speeds.   \t    \thttps://www.youtube.com/embed/RLpMa9geJ4o \t \thttps://youtu.be/RLpMa9geJ4o?t={seek_to_second_number}  &nbsp;    \tHow to dual mine Ethereum+Kaspa &amp; OC Tips \t \t  Download SRBMiner-MULTI   Unzip the archive somewhere   We will set up dual GPU mining of Ethereum + Kaspa   Go into miner folder, there is already a start-mining-ethereum-and-kaspa example.    Edit this file and change the --wallet parts to your own wallets. Also change --pool to the ones you like.   Let`s see some tips on how to get the most out from dual mining:     We start with OC settings you used for mining Ethereum only. The goal here will be to get as much KASPA as we can without losing a lot on Ethereum hashrate. Power draw will of course increase the more KASPA hashrate you get.   Note the auto defined intensity settings we get for this GPU. A0 value is the intensity for Ethereum, and A1 is for KASPA. We will only be changing A1 value, cause we are satisfied with Ethereum hashrate.   Increasing CORE clock and waiting a little bit to see how it affects the hashrates.   As you can see it barely added to KASPA hashrate. That`s because with increasing CORE clock we also must increase A1 intensity value to get any changes in hashrate!   We noted the default value of A1 was 4. Let`s try 8 now that we have increased the CORE clock.   --gpu-intensity 0;8 - meaning auto set intensity for Ethereum (A0), set intensity 8 for KASPA (A1)   Waiting a little bit to see the changes.   A1 (KASPA) hashrate rised a lot, but the A0 (Ethereum) hashrate is about the same as before. Good, we are on the right track.   Let`s increase A1 intensity more   We got a drop in A0 hashrate, and we don`t want that so we take back on A1 intensity until we find a value that suits our needs (that in this case is almost 100% Ethereum hashrate and as much as possible KASPA)   If you have a mix of GPU`s and want to set different intensity values the format is :    Let's assume you got 4 GPU's. Want to set A1 intensity like 2 8 4 4 (gpu0, gpu1, gpu2, gpu3)  --gpu-id 0!1!2!3 --gpu-intensity 0!0!0!0;2!8!4!4   This same rule for finding best settings (OC/intensity) applies to every combination of coins you want to dual mine. Always try to increase intensity value for A1 after you increased the CORE clock.  \t \t    \thttps://www.youtube.com/embed/0m7C7MkH070 \t \thttps://youtu.be/0m7C7MkH070?t={seek_to_second_number}  &nbsp;   Conclusions   It is impossible to get cryptocurrency without special programs.

        "excerpt":"               AMDMemoryTweak: Download from the official site and change Memory Timing Level.          In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up and use the latest AMD Memory Tweak v0.2.3 and newer.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download AMDMemoryTweak (GitHub) Download AMDMemoryTweakXL version       What is AMD Memory Tweak?           AMD Memory Tweak - is a new open source tool introduced by Eliovp and A. Solodovnikov. It is a tool that allows you to change graphics card memory timings on the fly like ETHlargementPill, but for AMD. This tool is also compatible with Vega. Works from the command line only.    AMDMemoryTweakXL - This version has a graphical shell. Works similar to your typical graphics card overclocking software such as MSI Afterburner, EVGA Precision XOC or Asus GPU Tweak II. However, Elievp and Solodovnikov’s program primarily focuses on the memory aspect, so it has more advanced features, one of which is the ability to adjust memory timings on the fly.   System requirements      OS: Windows 10 / Windows 8 / Windows 7 / Windows Vista / XP and Linux.   Driver: At least Radeon Software Adrenalin 19.4.1 (and AMDGPU-Pro for Linux).   Driver: At least Radeon Software Adrenalin 19.4.1 (and AMDGPU-Pro for Linux).   Supported Graphics Cards   The authors did not provide a compatibility list, but the program should work with a wide range of AMD Radeon graphics cards, ranging from older models with GDDR5 memory to the latest offerings with HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) and HBM2 memory.    How to use AMD Memory Tweak  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - download the software  \t\t \t\t \t\tDownload the program from the official developer repository - GitHub.. \t\t   \t\t  \t\tThe version for Windows is called WinAMDTweak.exe. However, you need to download all files (IOMap64.sys, IOMap.sys) and place them in one folder.  \t\t   \t\t \t  \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - launch AMD Memory Tweak  \t\t \t\t \t\t To work with the utility, you need to study the timings of the available video memory and create a file with the .bat extension with their optimal values ​​for mining.  To find out the current values ​​of the timings, enter the command in the batch file:  WinAMDTweak.exe --current pause        The performance of the video memory increases with decreasing latency. We need to lower the timing values ​​and apply them with this software. Keep in mind that video memory from different manufacturers (Samsung, Hynix, Micron, Elpida) have individual characteristics of overclocking timings (lines).       \t\t \t\t \t   \t \t \t \tStep 3 - change timings via bat file  \t \t \t For the Vega 56 video card with Hynix video memory, the timings will be as follows:   WinAMDTweak.exe --RAS 24 --RCDRD 19 --RCDWR 4 --RC 35 --RP 13 --RRDS 4 --RRDL 5 --RFC 148 --REF 15600   The launch is performed on the .bat file you created.   Since the timings are applied on the fly, in the event of a reboot, you will have to execute the command again. In order not to perform it every time, configure the batch file autoloading.  To autostart, put your .bat shortcut to Windows Startup. The startup folder in the Windows 10 operating system is located in the following path: C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup  Example for Samsung video memory:  WinAMDTweak.exe --ras 26 --rcdrd 13 --rcdwr 12 --rc 38 --rp 12 --rrds 3 --rrdl 5 --rtp 6 --faw 12 -- cwl 8 --wtrs 4 --wtrl 9 --wr 13 --ref 24000 --rfc 239      \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo guide  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Attention!  Miners PhoenixMiner and NBMiner already have a ready-made and built-in timing setting. Read about NBMiner and PhoenixMiner.   AMD Memory Tweak XL   As already mentioned, the XL version, unlike the usual one (CLI), has a graphical shell (GUI):        In it, you can make settings directly in the program window:        It is better to run the software as an administrator.   For GPUs of the Polaris family, add the parameter:   --REF 30   &nbsp;          Hive os - RX Boost - AmdMemTweak   I stopped the miner, then I go to Overclocking and here on this screen, there's a new parameter \"Mem tweak\". We suggest you put the value of 30 here, then click Save implies, this Overclocking ok. Then I start miner again. MD settings applied. We wait for the miner to settings up.

RX 5700   For RX 5700 this tool does not work. The developer of this tool opened his own production of rigs based on the 5700 with his own operating system.   NAVI and GDDR6 video memory   On GDDR6, the parameter is written --REF 30 in the timings when editing the BIOS. It is important to set it from 9000 to 16000. Changing timings on the fly for GDDR6 is locked.   In any case, NAVI will work the same as Vega 56/64. The memory bandwidth is the same. GDDR6 will perform slightly better due to tighter timings compared to HBM. The main result will be energy savings compared to the Vega.   Note!  RBE has fully decoded GDDR6 timings. Over 100 different sling timings. A stability of 60+ MH should be readily achievable.   RX 470/480/570/570X/580/580X/590   Use PhoenixMiner timings for these video cards.   Since with Polaris cards, you can use a bios mod or a miner that changes the timings itself.

A GUI utility that runs on Windows and Linux, not only allows you to overclock your AMD Radeon graphics card on the fly, but also tweak the memory timings. Most timings are applied in real time, but some require a reboot. Unfortunately, this means that they cannot be changed yet, as a reboot resets the timings to their default values. Of course, the utility allows you to change the frequency of the GPU core and control the operation of the fans.        &nbsp;          Low Power 51Mh/s Vega 64 With AMD Memory Tweaker!

The utility will not work on systems with Nvidia graphics cards.   Questions and answers       Strap failed to inject error?              Just make a few changes and click the \"inject\" button, then \"refresh from driver\", (the values ​​in the dropdown are the values ​​loaded from vbios in memory), if you click the \"refresh\" button, the tool will load the values ​​from the driver directly.               Conclusions   Most of the settings are in real time. However, some of the demanding memory timings may require a system reboot to be applied correctly.   Essentially, the modified BIOS will simply hard-code the memory timing, frequency, and voltage. But you can also apply them on the fly with OC and amdmemtweak.   So the graphics cards have a stock version of the BIOS in case of resale.   If you are mining on video cards, then it is recommended to use PhoenixMiner.   ","categories": ["tools"],

To start mining Ethereum using a Nanominer, you just need to enter your wallet into the configuration or batch file.    How to run Nanominer through a bat file  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download Nanominer  \t\t Nanopool provides a link to download Nanominer:   on GitHub and on the official website.       Go to the GitHub repository. Find \"Assets\":    Download the most recent ZIP archive for Windows 10 or your other operating system. Unpack the downloaded archive to a convenient place (for example, on the Desktop).       \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure Nanominer  \t\t \t\t After you have unpacked the archive, you will see the configuration files .ini. You need to edit these default config files or create a .bat file.        Let's start with the .bat file. In the same folder as nanominer.exe, you need to create a file with the extension .bat.   Just copy any .ini file and give it the extension .bat.   Open the .bat file with Notepad. Below is an example of a setup for Ethereum. You need to add the following commands to it:   helper_scripts/cmdline_launcher -algo ethash -coin eth -pool1 ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -wallet username1 -rigName RIG_ID pause    Instead, username1 just insert your username from the Binance Pool.     \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - start Nanominer  \t After everything is done in step 2, you are ready to mine. All that's left to do is launch the miner and then go to the Binance Pool, where you can track your mining progress.   The program is launched in a standard way: double-click the left mouse button on the file with the extension .bat. After starting, a window opens indicating all the entered parameters.         \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo guide  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Setting up via Config using Ravencoin as an example   An alternative launch option would be setting instead of a batch file through a configuration file. It has the extension .ini   By default, the program reads the settings from a file config.ini and runs through nanominer.exe.   Listing of the configured file for Ravencoin:   ; Address to send funds to. Change this address to yours! wallet = RAXCRKF2JdYwYLn2RiMxDPNgvKMwfVrjY9  ; Coin to mine. coin = RVN  ; (Optional) Rig (worker) name. rigName = speed_test   In the config file, you need to change three things:      wallet - insert here the address of your wallet from the mined cryptocurrency.   coin - indicate the ticker of the coin (usually it is displayed on the exchange). Leave RVN for Ravencoin.   rigName - specify the name of the worker (your mining rig).   Here’s what we should get:           Double click the file nanominer.exe in the Nanominer folder.   A window will appear showing the progress of the miner as he connects to the pool, adjusts a few more parameters and starts mining. On Windows it will look something like the window below.      That’s it, you mine RVN from Nanopool with Nanominer!   Now let’s check our Nanopool progress. Visit nanopool.org in a web browser.   Click RavenCoin on the main page.   In the upper right corner of the page, paste your wallet address and click Search.     You will receive either a page with statistics for your mining farm, or a page where no account was found, which (assuming your wallet was configured correctly) means that you have to wait until your farm finds a few shares (solutions).      We are waiting for the cannon to report Total shares at least 1.      We update the page that reported “Account Not Found” and see that the statistics have appeared:      After mining another ten minutes, a graph with a hash rate will appear.   Mine on Nvidia?

Reboot   restarts - the parameter sets the number of miner restarts before restarting the farm. In case of problems with the video card, such as hardware errors or lagging, or if the hash rate drops (if the minhashrate option is used), nanominer will restart. However, some errors cannot be corrected by restarting the program. In such cases, you need to reboot the rig. To reboot, the miner loads the script reboot.bat from the current directory, if it is running on Windows, or reboot.sh if on Linux.   For Windows:   shutdown /r /t 5 /f   For Linux:   reboot   Troubleshooting   Having problems? There are only a few things that can really go wrong. They include:   First, give the software ten or fifteen minutes before claiming something went wrong. After we found our first share, our wallet address does not display the statistics page for ten minutes.   If you have waited more than 15 minutes and still do not see the mining statistics page, check the following:      One or more values ​​were incorrectly set in the file .ini.   You have inserted the wrong wallet address when searching.   There is something wrong with your mining rig.   The nanopool does not work.   Next steps:      There are many more options available for T-rex Miner. To find out more, read the setup instructions.   If you haven’t already, try overclocking your video cards to increase the hashrate.

On the MiniZ website, you can choose to download cuda 8 or cuda 10. Cuda 10 is for newer drivers, 411.31 or newer. If you have a 10 series GPU with older drivers, download Cuda 8. Be aware that a newer RTX version (20 series) will not work on Cuda 8. You can try both Cuda 8 and 10 for GTX (series ten).   To start saving logs for miniZ, add a parameter --log to the mining configuration.   Having problems? There are many more options available for T-rex Miner.

Download for Windows / Linux   Download from site  Download from BitcoinTalk       What is Bminer?           Bminer – is a miner with support for many hashing algorithms. It works on both NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards. The developer’s commission ranges from 0.65% to 2%, depending on the mining algorithm. The software supports mining in dual mining mode.     Requirements      OS: Windows x64, Linux   At least 4 GB of video memory.   Installed Microsoft Visual C ++ 2015 component.   The last time the miner was updated was in 2021. The Bminer project is “dead” despite the fact that it can still mine some coins.   Use alternative miners.

In the same folder as bminer.exe, you need to create or edit an existing file with the extension .bat.  Just create any .txt file and give it the extension .bat.   Open the .bat file with Notepad. Below is a sample configuration for the 2miners Pool. You need to enter the following commands into it:   bminer.exe -uri raven://RKzUGLFtdMUQgCstmufnWamA5RwN74yHU8.rigid@rvn.2miners.com:6060\t pause   Replace RKzUGLFtdMUQgCstmufnWamA5RwN74yHU8 with your Ravencoin wallet address.    \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Run the miner  \t It remains only to run the program.   Important note! You don't run bminer.exe. Instead, you click on the file you just created with the extension .bat.

Windows or Linux.    How to set up BzMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t Download the miner from two official sources to choose from:  on the official site  or from GitHub.      Go to the site. Find the \"Releases\" section and below \"Assets\":    Download the most recent version from the top of the spreadsheet for Windows 10. Unpack the downloaded archive .       \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure BzMiner  \t\t \t\t After extracting the archive, you need to create the .bat files.        In the same folder as bzminer.exe, you need to create or modify an existing file with the extension .bat.   Just create a file .txt and give it the extension .bat.   Open the .bat file with Notepad. Below is a sample configuration for a Binance pool. You need to enter the following commands into it:    bzminer -a ethash -w username1 -p ethproxy+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 pause   Instead username1 just enter your username from the Binance pool. For more information, see What is a Binance Account and How Do I Open One?   \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Run the miner  \t Now you need to start the miner.   Important note! You don't start bzminer.exe. Instead, you click on the .bat file you just created .   So, after starting the program for a few minutes, you will see a window with a hash rate:        \t \t  \t \t \t \tBZMiner Saved GPU Mining And NEXA. NEXA+ZIL  BZMiner Saved GPU Mining And NEXA.

Does not start miner   100% LHR unlocker   BzMiner introduced a 100% LHR unlocker.   If a card becomes unstable (eg. lhr exception), lower overclocks, and lower --lhr_stability.   --lhr_stability has an impact on both hashrate and stability of the LHR unlock. Higher values will increase hashrate, but may cause GPUs to crash. Lower values are more stable, but may cause LHR to trigger momentarily, lowering hashrate a little. Play with it.   To disable the LHR unlocker, set --lhr_stability to 0. Default is 100.   The LHR unlock can sometimes trigger an “LHR Exception”. If this happens, lower the --lhr_stability option. This “exception” will allow the device to continue mining, but at a much slower speed. It requires a hard device reset to recover, which means restarting the pc. BzMiner provides the --lhr_exception option, which if set to true and a card experiences the LHR exception, will reboot the pc.      --lhr_stability INT … - Set the LHR Unlock Stability value for each device. Lower is more stable, higher is less stable and higher hashrate. Default is 100.   --lhr_exception_reboot - Reboot the pc when an LHR exception happens on a device (device hard reset currently requires pc reboot).    \tKASPA mining tutorial Windows &amp; HiveOS \t \t Run a node:  kaspad /utxoindex:  Create a wallet:  kaspawallet create:  Run wallet daemon  kaspawallet start-daemon  Check balance (with daemon running):  kaspawallet balance  Run tmrlvi gpu miner:   kaspaGPUminer.exe -s [Node IP or address] -a [KASPA address] --workload [number]  for AMD add:  --opencl-enable and replace --workload with --opencl-workload   \t  \t \t \thttps://www.youtube.com/embed/WFuyE_Er768 \t \thttps://youtu.be/WFuyE_Er768?t={seek_to_second_number}   Dual Mining   BzMiner allows you to set overclocking for each dual mining algorithm. Be aware that extreme overclocking settings can cause the GPU to freeze (crash) much more easily in this scenario. For this reason, the oc_delay_ms configuration option is used to give the OC time to power up before switching to the next algorithm.   Here is an example dual lane configuration with overclocking options for each algorithm:   {     \"pool_configs\": [{             \"algorithm\": \"ethash\",             \"wallet\": \"0000\",             \"url\": [\"stratum+tcp://us2.ethermine.org:4444\"],             \"lhr_only\": false         }, {             \"algorithm\": \"alph\",             \"wallet\": \"0000\",             \"url\": [\"stratum+tcp://eu.metapool.tech:20032\", \"stratum+tcp://pool.woolypooly.com:3106\"],             \"username\": \"alph_rig\",             \"lhr_only\": false         }],     \"pool\": [0, 1],     \"intensity\": [0],     \"multi_mine_ms\": [5000, 15000],     \"rig_name\": \"ethash_rig\",     \"log_file\": \"\",     \"clear_log_file\": false,     \"nvidia_only\": false,     \"amd_only\": false,     \"lock_config\": false,     \"advanced_config\": false,     \"oc_delay_ms\": 100,     \"device_overrides\": [{             \"uid\": \"1:0\",             \"name\": \"EVGA RTX 3090 FTW3 Ultra\",             \"start_mining\": true,             \"lhr_mine_ms\": [5000, 15000],             \"oc_fan_speed\": [-1],             \"oc_power_limit\": [0],             \"oc_core_clock_offset\": [-200, 50],             \"oc_memory_clock_offset\": [1100, 0],             \"oc_lock_core_clock\": [0],             \"oc_lock_memory_clock\": [0, 810]         }] }    Alternatives   Are there alternatives to this program?

How to set up TeamBlackMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t There are two official download sources:  on github  or from the BitcoinTalk forum.      Go to GitHub. In the \"Releases\" section, you will see \"Assets\":    Download the most recent version at the top of the table for your OS. The downloaded archive must be extracted. Extract the zip archive.       \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure TeamBlackMiner  \t\t \t\t After unpacking the archive, you need to create or edit the finished .batfiles.       In the same folder as teamblackminer.exe, you will need to create or modify an existing file with the extension .bat.   To create a new one - just create a file .txt and give it an extension .bat.  Open the .bat file with Notepad. Below is an example setup for a Binance pool. You need to enter the following commands into it:   Set USERNAME=username1  :loop \tTBMiner --algo ethash --hostname ethash.poolbinance.com --port 1800 --wallet %USERNAME% --worker-name 001 --xintensity 24 \ttimeout 10 goto :loop   Set USERNAME=username1 - Do you see at the very beginning?   Instead username1 just enter your username from the Binance pool. For more information, see «What Is Binance Mining Account and How to Create It » For example, enter: Set USERNAME=MyBinanceLogin  \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Run the miner  \t After you have edited the provided run script you can run it by dobble-click.   Attention! You don't start teamblackminer.exe. Instead, you click on the .bat file you just created.   So, after starting the program for a few minutes, you will see a window with a hashrate:        \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tTeam Black Miner HiveOS NiceHash Setup, Hash Increase!  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Configuring for Ethermine      Pool address: eu1.ethermine.org   PORT: 4444   Wallet address: 0x3aa3e06C47caDEf96202D378aB7C407CF46A36A4             0x3aa3e06C47caDEf96202D378aB7C407CF46A36A4 - specify your wallet address.   worker-name=name - specify the name of the worker (replace name with the name of your worker.

Yes. The Team Black miner was added on 22th October 2021.                 What is the best pools for this miner?                         Since, TBM can produce more than 1-2 % stales with high intensity (--xintensity), pools that reward stale shares is the best for this miner.             Also a high difficulty pool port is recomended with a high intensity setting.             Note that the ethereum blockchain rewards stale work/blocks. They are called uncle blocks. The uncle blocks are protecting the security of the blockchain.             The ethereum blockchain pay 87.5% for level 1 stale shares. 6 levels of stale shares are payed, but the lower levels have a lower payout (lower level means later in time).             Most mining pools reward stale work, but some have a buildt in limit of 5% allowed stales. So if you mine with more than 5% stales, the pools can start rejecting your shares or ignore them.             Good pools for TBMiner:                         miningpoolhub (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             2miners (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             nanopool (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             woolypooly (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             antpool (100% reward for  level 1 stale shares)             spiderpool (100% reward for  level 1 stale shares)             f2pool (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             uupool (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             xnpool.com (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             ezil (70% reward for stale shares)             hiveon (50% reward for stale shares)                                     What is the best --xintensity --dagintensity and --kernel setting?                         You can try for yourself or ask others. Different GPU cards might have different best settings, both with OC and the intensity setting. And the pool is important.             High --xintensity, higher amout of stale shares, higher speed.             Some pools doesn’t pay for stales so the setting is pool dependent.             --dagintensity: 1-8(9) is for high memclocks. Use when dag buffer crash on validation. 1 is low (slow dag) 8 on amd is the fastest,  9 on nvidia (0 is default).             --kernel: Different kernels can give a speedup on different models. Your power setting can also count. Autotune will try to find the fastest kernel for you.                       NVIDIA cards:             Miners have reported that --xintensity 3100 and  --xintensity 4096 works good on f2pool.com and 2miners.com             AMD cards:             AMD intensity settings  are 1/4 of NVIDIA.             For no stale shares use something like --xintensity 24 or --xintensity 8 (flexpool, crazypool, nicehash).             -- xintensity -1 is good on miningpoolhub, nanopool, f2pool and 2miners.                          --xintensity 60 works good on the RX 580.             --xintensity 78 works good on the 6800XT.                                     It says the pool is not supported?               Ask us to add it. We will configure the miner.                  The miner produce stales?                           Yes it might. You can lower the intensity setting (--xintensity) to reduce stale shares.               With the right settings you could have none.               But you can also see stale shares as an extra bonus to accepted shares if you use a pool that pays for stale shares.                      What boards are known to be good for this miner?              A lot, mostly the new cards.   Nvidia RTX series 20xx, 30xx and Amd series 5xxx, 6xxx are known to work very well with this miner.                 TBMiner exits with message dag verification failed?                             Add the commandline option --dagintensity with a low value to prevent computing errors with high OC.                 If it still exits with the message, try lowering OC.                               Is it a computer virus?              No. No way. But viruses are known to exploit coin mining for profit.                 It is not working, why?                             See Install Windows or Install Linux.

        "excerpt":"               Electrum wallet: review, download, addresses, iPhone, fee, and recovery          In this manual you will learn how to download and how to use Electrum v4.3.4 and newer.   Download for Windows/Linux        Official site GitHub Download APK   What is Electrum?           Electrum is a bitcoin wallet for Windows, Linux, MacOS and Android. In addition to storing BTC, modified versions of Electrum can also be used for altcoins. The app offers some features like two-factor authentication to protect your assets from hackers.     It was developed by the German computer scientist Thomas Vögtlin1. This application should be efficient and easy to use.         Pros:         High level of anonymity and security     Easy setup on different devices     Suitable for beginners     Open source          Cons:         Supports only 1 cryptocurrency - Bitcoin only     Lack of customer support     Confusing commission scheme      Supported coins   Electrum only supports Bitcoin. The project has never supported any altcoins, only BTC. Thus, neither Ethereum nor Monero is supported in the main version of the application.   However, Electrum is open source software and there are many forks that support certain altcoins. Over the years, many developers have contributed to the open source code, which is available to everyone on Github.2           Wallet Name: Electrum   Accepted coins: Bitcoin only   Supported exchanges: all major bitcoin exchanges   Countries: Available worldwide   Languages: 29, including English   Mobile Compatibility: The Android wallet was released in 2016 for mobile use   An iOS version is coming soon.   Safety and reliability   Experts rank Electrum as one of the most secure wallets on the market. Recently, the number of cryptocurrencies has been increasing, but this application is designed purely as a bitcoin wallet. It excludes all other currencies. Thus, it has high working speed and safety.   The main highlight of the application is its focus on security. Electrum not only ensures that your assets are not lost during unforeseen events, but also allows you to recover them using secret seed phrase.        According to update reviews3, Electrum is the most secure bitcoin wallet due to the encryption methods used to protect private keys. Electrum has a highly secure seed phrase, a random passphrase used to generate keys. That is why the application offers the same level of security as the Bitcoin private key.   Two-factor authentication provides enhanced wallet security. Two independent encryption methods continue to protect you from any danger.4   What are the fees?   The total fee is 0.2 mBtc (Millibitcoin), but in some cases it can be reduced to 0.1 mBtc or lower. All fees are already included in the displayed amount. A warning will appear if your wallet balance is below the fee.        How to use Electrum  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the Software  \t\t First, you need to make the appropriate selection for your operating system in order to download. Go to download section of the company website.      After downloading the software, proceed to the second step. \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Install the wallet  \t\t \t\t Double-click the downloaded file. Until you can change the language, installation is initially in English. At the beginning of the installation, you are asked how to connect to the server. Select \"Auto connect\".      Now you decide whether you want to open a new wallet or restore the old one. Click \"Next\" to install a new wallet.         Then you need to specify what type of wallet you want to create. You have four different options:      Standard wallet Wallet with two-factor authentication Multi-signature wallet Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys.  Essentially, this is the choice of the type of seed phrase. You will most likely have to select \"Standard\".   The app will now ask: Do you want to create a new seed phrase or restore your wallet using an existing one?   Create a new seed I already have a seed Use a master key Use a hardware device.  To create a wallet, select \"Create a new seed\".       Now the most important step, because you must remember the following wallet generation data with 12 consecutive words:       Then you need to enter these words to make sure that you wrote them down or saved them correctly.      Start typing your words one at a time. The software itself will offer options for autocomplete words.       In the last step, you can (and should) create a password, but it's not required.     \t\t \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Get your address and fund your wallet  \t Get your address. Go to the \"Receive\" tab. Click \"Create Request\".       Go to the \"Receive\" tab. Click the \"Address\" button. Click the \"copy\" button.      The characters in the Address field are your personal wallet address. Now you can fund your account using your personal address.     \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t        \tHow To Setup and Use Electrum Wallet (Step By Step)  \t \tHow To Setup &amp; Use Electrum Wallet  (Step By Step).

Therefore, you should store your passphrase offline. It is necessary to make it so that unauthorized access to your phrase is practically impossible.     There are 3 recovery options:          “I already have a seed” - when you have a SEED phrase     “Use a master key” - use a master key for recovery     “Use a hardware device” - use a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger).       The wallet recovery algorithm is as follows:                 Launch Electrum and create a new wallet.                  Select “Standard Wallet”.                     Select “Use a hardware device” if you want to use a seed phrase from a hardware wallet. If you have a seed phrase written down on paper, then select the “I already have a seed” option.              Select your bitcoin address format in your wallet account.        legacy (p2pkh) This account is similar to legacy accounts with addresses starting with 1 that do not support SegWit.     p2sh-segwit (p2wpkh-p2sh) This account is similar to the standard account with addresses starting with 3 and SegWit support.            native segwit (p2wpkh) This account supports the Bech32 standard and is not fully supported yet, but is supported by the Trezor firmware.

You can download the latest version of Portable Electrum from the link below:     Download Portable Version               Can I install Electrum on Iphone?                        At the moment it is not possible. An iOS version is coming soon.  Using Electrum on a phone is a bad idea from a privacy point of view. Electrum is an SPV client, which means it connects to a server that collects all information related to your wallet. But things get even worse when this collected information is combined with data received from motion sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, which are found in every smartphone. This data can be easily captured by surveillance services, which can create digital footprints of your walking patterns and identify you at any time.    Avoid using Electrum on iPhone. Better install BlueWallet. You can also connect BlueWallet to any Electrum server. This may be important to you if you are running your own server.                                Does Electrum support Ethereum, Monero, USDT or Litecoin?                       Wallet does not support Ethereum or Monero. For Ethereum, you can install MyEtherWallet. It’s also open source. For Monero, use Gui Wallet.                              Electrum is better than Exodus?                       When comparing Electrum and Exodus in terms of ease of use, Exodus definitely wins with its more beginner-friendly modern design. Not only is Exodus easier to use, but it also has things like live charts and visualizations to help you see what’s going on with your assets.

        "excerpt":"         Fast Sync, Import Private Key, Address, and Passphrase          In this manual, you will learn how to download and use the latest Doge Coin wallet version 1.14.6 and newer.   Download for Windows/Linux        Official site  Official GitHub  Download section   What is Dogecoin Core?           The Dogecoin Core Wallet was specifically designed to store DOGE with downloads of the entire cryptocurrency blockchain1. Therefore, installing this wallet takes longer, but provides more reliability because you do not depend on a third-party full node to validate transactions on the blockchain.     The official Dogecoin wallet is available for most used operating systems - Windows, MacOS, and Linux in two versions - 64 and 32 Bit.              Pros:         High level of anonymity and security     Open source     Private keys are not stored on third-party servers          Cons:         No two-factor authentication     Extremely slow blockchain synchronization     Not the easiest settings      Overview of Features and Functions   This app is based on Bitcoin QT wallet. This means that the app supports all the same features as wallets for Bitcoin, Dash, Verge, and more.   10 important features:      Backup support.   Support for viewing all transaction records with the ability to display only the latest ones.   Support for signed messages. You can sign the message to prove that you really own the address.   Ability to select any folder to save wallet data.   Prune - the ability to trim the blockchain up to 3 GB. This allows you not to store the entire blockchain of Dodge Coin (about 52 GB).   Save favorite addresses and export them.   Support for RPC commands for advanced settings via command line.   The function “Encrypt wallet” allows you to encrypt your wallet using a password.   Generate paper wallet for printing.   You can import private keys from other wallets into this one.   Is it a good and safe wallet?   The client provides a high level of security since private keys will be generated and stored only on your computer2.      This application is also secure because it is limited to only one cryptocurrency. This means that all the efforts of the developers are focused around one coin. Thus, if you have a lot of DOGE coins, it is advisable to have this wallet. And while it can take up a lot of disk space, it provides a high level of security for your assets.    The installed app looks like this:        What are the fee?   There are no transaction fees on the platform from this wallet. But users have to pay network fees (to DOGE miners) which create transaction confirmations.        How to Create a Dogecoin Core Wallet  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the software  \t\t On the Dogecoin Core downloads page, we see that there are wallets based on operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. Choose the version for your operating system.      After downloading the software, proceed to the second step - installation.  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Install the wallet  \t\t \t\t  Double-click the software installer. The \"User Account Control\" will open. Click \"Yes\":      Click \"Next\" in the welcome window:      Select a folder for installation. Please note that the Dogecoin blockchain takes up over 40 GB of disk space:     Select a folder for the start menu shortcut and click \"Install\":     Wait for the installation to complete and click \"Next\":     Click \"Finish\" and tick \"Run Dogecoin Core\" to open the wallet:     Since the program is running for the first time, you can choose where Dogecoin Core will store the data. The application will download and save a complete copy of the blockchain. This directory will store at least 57 GB of data and will grow over time. The wallet will also be stored in this directory.     The firewall will ask if you want to allow the application to access the network? Click \"Allow access\":     Move your cursor to the lower right area. You will see the number of active connections for network synchronization. Synchronization speed depends on the number of connections and on the type of your hard drive.     Click the \"Hide\" button to hide the sync window and find your address:       \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Get your address and fund your wallet  \t   To get the wallet address, go to the \"Much Receive\" tab.      Click \"Request payment\". You will see a window with your Dogecoin address:      Click the \"Copy Address\" button. Your address will be copied to the clipboard. Example: DEQegauv4qxYzvqURkafKTNZnMtR3NJEpn  Using your address, you can fund your wallet.   \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t       Please note that recent transactions will not be displayed until you fully sync your wallet with the network. Therefore, the current balance may not be accurate. The balance information will be corrected after full synchronization with the network.     Synchronizing with network     As soon as a new node (network member) joins the network, its first task is to download and validate the entire blockchain. This is an essential step in the distributed nature of cryptocurrencies because only in this way can a node claim to have independently verified all transactions. The application must scan the entire blockchain for the entire history of the existence of the coin.     During the sync process, your latest transactions will not be visible and therefore your wallet balance will be incorrect.     How long does synchronization take? It can take up to 30 hours on an average computer. When you launch the application, you will see the following screen:                 Number of blocks left - shows how many blocks still need to be downloaded     Last block time - shows the time of the block that is being synchronized     Progress - general progress bar     Progress increase per hour - displays the average percentage of synchronization speed for 1 hour     Estimated time left until synced - displays an estimate of the sync time       Synchronizing headers     In “Syncing headers” mode, the new node first downloads all the block headers, which are very small (about 80 bytes, while the block size can be up to 1 MB). Once a node has received all the headers, from the genesis block to the current top of the blockchain, only then does it start downloading full blocks3. This process can be extremely slow due to a large number of blocks and the slow HDD.            Stuck syncing headers     If your wallet is stuck and not syncing, you must run a few commands in Help &gt; Debug window &gt; Console:            In the Debug window, select Console:            Enter the following commands one by one:          getblockhash stuck-block-# - returns the hash of the stuck block for steps 2 and 3.     invalidateblock stuck-block-hash - marks the block as invalid and adds it to the set!     reconsiderblock stuck-block-hash - remove a block from an invalid block set.     clearbanned - clears hung nodes.       After that, your wallet should start re-syncing.     After the Syncing headers process is completed, the main synchronization will begin:            Slow sync issue     The speed of synchronization is largely dependent on the individual performance of your computer, provided that everything is in order with your Internet and with the cryptocurrency network.     If you want fast syncing, you need a fast computer, plenty of RAM, a fast SSD drive, and fast internet. From personal experience, using an SSD increased the sync speed by more than 10 times on our test system compared to the performance of an HDD drive.     How ​​to speed up sync?         Add nodes to the configuration manually.     Change the configuration settings (database cache size and other network settings).     Use a lightweight wallet that does not require downloading the entire blockchain. For example, MultiDoge.     Use an SSD drive. You can move the truncated blockchain directory (about 3 GB) to an SSD. If your laptop does not have an SSD, you can use an SSD flash drive.     Download the blockchain by torrent.       How to download Bootstrap Blockchain as a torrent?     The Dogecoin Core client contains the Bootstrap.dat file. This is a file containing a copy of the blockchain from the genesis block up to a certain point in time.     Steps to speed up the synchronization of your Dogecoin wallet:          Make sure Dogecoin Core is not running in your task manager/system monitor. If you closed the app, wait for the process to complete:        Make sure you have a backup copy of your wallet.dat file. This is the file with your coins. Press Win+R and go to C:\\Users\\%usernmae%\\AppData\\Roaming\\DogeCoin\\                     Download the latest bootstrap with all blockchain data so you don’t have to start syncing from the beginning. This GitHub page belongs to one of the Dogecoin developers.        Go to C:\\Users\\%usernmae%\\AppData\\Roaming\\DogeCoin\\ and back up the wallet.dat file, as well as the blocks, database and chainstate folders.        After creating the backup, delete the following folders and files: blocks, database and chainstate folders, dogecoin.conf and peers.dat files.

Usually, just waiting will eventually solve this problem.     But if the application is too long and unable to connect to other network participants, this can be fixed with add nodes. To fix this, you need to add peers manually.

You can view your wallet address, copy the address and save the QR code. The software implements:          paper wallet. It looks like an image with a public key, a private key, an address, and a QR code:        automatic creation of a payment QR code:        generate payment URL:        export address book:        there is also a payment request function:          Paper Wallet     A paper wallet refers to a cryptocurrency storage method in which a user prints out a private key and its associated address on paper and uses that address to deposit funds.            With a paper wallet, you can:         import this private key to the wallet,     check the balance,     spend the funds through the wallet.       When importing a private key into a wallet, users typically use the method of having the wallet scan the QR code of the private key in Wallet Import Format (WIF).          WIF (Wallet Import Format) is a private key that corresponds to one address in the blockchain. WIF is needed in order to transfer funds from one wallet to another. The WIF format is simply Base58 encoded key bytes + checksum.4        Disadvantages and risks of paper wallets    Paper wallets are generally considered a secure way to store funds for the long term, but this method has its downsides.          Problems related to printing and print media:                paper wallets require the use of a printer to transfer them to paper, and using a network printer in an unsecured environment is risky;         although QR codes have a checksum and extensive error correction capabilities, the printed media can be damaged by water, dirt, or paper wrinkling and folding.                 Address reuse:                there is only one address in a paper wallet, which leads to problems with reuse.                 Bad user experience:                since the process of working with raw private keys can be non-intuitive, it can lead to loss of funds if you do not understand what you are doing. Paper wallet users are advised to understand their features before using them as a long-term storage method.                    \tHow To Generate Paper wallet in Dogecoin Core Walle \t\t \t \t in this video we discuss Dogecoin paper wallets, You should  use a Dogecoin paper wallet to store your cryptocurrency if you value your hodl safety.    \thttps://www.youtube.com/embed/kZKCY-CNWW0 \t \thttps://youtu.be/kZKCY-CNWW0?t={seek_to_second_number}     Address QR code     In cryptocurrency, QR codes are a static version of a QR code. Once you create a QR code, it becomes permanent and will always lead users to that address if someone can scan it with a smartphone. Static QR codes are best for single use because they cannot be edited or tracked.            Import and export private key     To import a key into Dogecoin Core, go to File &gt; Import Private Key:            Enter the key and name (optional) in the window and click “import”:            If you have a printed paper wallet, then you can reprint the private key.

Be extremely careful. If you forget or lose your password, it will be impossible to unlock your wallet!     Passphrase requirements:          “Please use a passphrase of ten or more random characters or eight or more words.”        Save, or better yet, write down your password on multiple media so you don’t lose it.      \tHow To Encrypt Dogecoin Core Wallet \t \tLearn how to Protect a Crytpo Wallet. Dogecoin Core developers enabled a feature inside the Dogecoin client that lets you “encrypt” your wallet by protecting it with a passphrase. By using a passphrase, you “lock” your coins from being spent. Even if an attacker were to gain access to the device on which your bitcoin wallet is running, they would not be able to do anything with the funds unless they also had your passphrase. Therefore, you should properly encrypt your Dogecoin wallet. The latest Dogecoin Core client contains a feature that encrypts your wallet with a passphrase.

Click the Prune block storage to 3 GB checkbox.     Reverting this setting will require a reload of the entire blockchain.            The Size of database cache is set to 450 MB by default. We recommend that you increase this one depending on the amount of RAM available on your system.     2 GB RAM: Set dbcache to 768 MB (0.75 GB) 4GB RAM: Set dbcache to 1024MB (1GB) 8 GB RAM: Set dbcache to 2048 MB (2 GB) 16GB RAM (or more): Set dbcache to 4096MB (4GB)       System requirements:         At least 50 GB of disk space;     Hard disk with high read/write speed;     Ideally a solid state drive (SSD) or mechanical disk with a large amount of cache memory;     Stable and fast internet connection.       If you are more advanced user, you can create a file dogecoin.conf with dbcache setting.     -dbcache=450       number of script verification threads option - if your system is very slow when the application is open, limit the number of threads or CPU/cores used.     Rescanning - command rescanning     Rescan (-rescan) - This command rescans your blockchain files for missing transactions. The client stores the transactions he manages in the wallet. If it sees a new transaction, it checks if that transaction affects the accounts stored in the wallet. If so, the wallet is updated.     Commands:     rescanblockchain (start_height stop_height)       The stop_height and stop_height parameters are optional. They indicate the interval between the start and end of the scan height.     Example:    rescanblockchain 100000 120000       For Mac, open “Terminal.app” and enter this command:     /Applications/Dogecoin-Qt.app/Contents/MacOS/Dogecoin-Qt --rescan       The second method is suitable for Windows and Linux. Edit dogecoin.conf.     Add this line:    rescan=1       Save, then run the application.     After you complete the rescan and close the application, don’t forget to restore dogecoin.conf and remove the rescan=1 parameter.     You can find all other commands in the Command line options tab:            Core or Multidoge lite     The difference between them lies in the blockchain. MultiDoge syncs faster, which is why it is called a “light” wallet. And Dogecoin Core is more reliable, but takes longer due to the overall synchronization of the blockchain. For beginners, we recommend MultiDoge Wallet. It will give you first impressions and ease of use of the e-wallet. If you want to buy more Dogecoin, you should switch to the more secure Dogecoin Core wallet.     Mining     Dogecoin can no longer be efficiently mined with a CPU.

How to fix java not found error in MultiDoge  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download and Install Java  \t\t  Skip this step if you already have Java installed.  When this error occurs, you see \"Java has not been found on your computer. Do you want to download it?\"     Download the latest version of the application from the official Java website.      After downloading the software, proceed with the installation. Click \"Yes\":       Click \"Install\":      Wait for the installation to complete:      Click \"Close\":       \t\t \t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Specify Java Environment Variables  \t\t \t\t  MultiDoge cannot open because Java environment variables are not set on the system. Namely, the variable Path is not set. Although Java is already on your system, the application will say \"java not installed\" until you make the following changes:   Open environment variable settings. The easiest way to open them is to type \"path\" in the Windows settings search and select \"Edit environment variables for your account\"     The second way is to open the System applet and then select Advanced system settings -&gt; Environment Variables.     In the window that opens, click \"New...\"    Enter the environment variables your version of Java. You can find out the version by going to the folder with Java installed. Example: C:\\Program Files\\Java    In the Variable name field, enter: JAVA_HOME  In Variable value:C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_341\\bin  If you have a different version, then instead of jre1.8.0_341, enter the name of your folder.

Follow the instructions to open the application.2      Go to .config/MultiDoge or %appdata%\\MultiDoge depending on your OS.      Back up your wallet. The file has a .wallet extension. Copy it to a safe place. You can put it in DropBox or OneDrive and encrypt it with a password. Better yet, copy the entire folder before deleting it.   Delete the MultiDoge folder in .config/ or %appdata%   If the folder cannot be deleted because “the file is already open by another program”, open the task manager and end the javaw.exe and MultiDoge.exe processes.   Launch MultiDoge.   Open your .wallet using File &gt; Open Wallet.   Set your preferences using View &gt; Preferences.   If you have any shortcuts for your addresses, they are stored in your .info files, so save those files as well.   Wallet synchronization not working   Method 1: transfer wallet to another application   You will need your wallet passwords in order to export the private key. If you have a private key, use the Exodus wallet. In this app, there is a Move Funds section in the 3-dot drop-down menu. Enter your private key there and it will transfer all funds to your Exodus wallet.   You can also transfer the private key to Dogecoin Core.   Method 2: Update checkpoints   If you are far behind in sync, then this guide is for you. Even if you are currently already synced, it’s worth following this guide to be prepared for future resyncs. These new checkpoints contain blocks until January 30, 2021. If you are trying to sync a wallet that was created before the summer of 2016, then unfortunately this will not help you.   How to quickly sync MultiDoge?3      Completely close MultiDoge.   Download this file: multidoge.checkpoints   Copy this file to the MultiDoge data directory. See the path below. Overwrite the existing file. If you have already synced to this step, then you are all set. If not, continue.   Launch MultiDoge.   From the MultiDoge menu, select Tools, then Reset Blockchain and Transactions.   On the tab that appears, click Reset blockchain and transactions (Reset blockchain and transactions).   Congratulations, you just updated your checkpoints! If after step 6 you no longer see your balance, don’t worry. It will appear after the synchronization is completed.

After each re-opening, sync progresses a bit until it stops again. After 5-6 re-openings, we eventually saw the DOGE we had.            Immediately go to Tools -&gt; Export Private Keys -&gt; Do not password encrypt.            Then find multidoge.key in C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\MultiDoge and open it in a text editor. Create a new wallet at Dogechain.info and then use the ‘Import Wallet’ option to paste it into separate keys from the multidoge.key file.

Download for Windows/Linux        Official site  Official GitHub  Download releases   What is MultiDoge?           MultiDoge Wallet is a desktop client software for storing Dogecoin cryptocurrency. It will create a wallet on your computer, allowing you to receive and send Dogecoin immediately. It was ported from the Multibit client, a very popular bitcoin wallet, but retained the same characteristics: simplicity, convenience, and speed.     This wallet is from the core Dogecoin development team.1 There are open-source versions for Windows, Linux, and OS X. In addition to MultiDoge, there is another client - Dogecoin Core.              Pros:         no need to download the entire Dogecoin blockchain     supports import and export of private keys     convenient to use          Cons:         not recommended for mining     does not develop the Dogecoin network     and sometimes does not find Java. Because of this, it won’t open.     cannot open wallet files from Core client (wallet.dat files)       MultiDoge or Dogecoin Core                          MultiDoge       Dogecoin Core                       Import and export private key       yes       yes                 Backup       yes       yes                 Support wallet.dat       no       yes                 Disk capacity       150 MB       50 GB                 Synchronization       fast       slow                 Security       medium       high                 Commission       not charged       not charged                 Mining       no       yes           MultiDoge cannot be used for mining, as with such use, the wallet will become slow and will not respond to requests.   MultiDoge is a lightweight wallet, if we want to mine, we should use “Dogecoin Core”.   The summary is:   If you are a beginner, you just want to try Dogecoin, you are not going to mine, you have problems with disk space or you just need a wallet that syncs quickly with the network, we recommend trying this wallet.   In all other cases, use Dogecoin Core or another client.   Safety and reliability   The wallet has many advantages and strengths. But we wouldn’t recommend it as the best or safest option.   The application is based on the Multibit Bitcoin client2, which was acquired by KeepKey, and then discontinued support. Therefore, this application has not been updated for a long time.   Notably, the wallet lacks most of the security features that the cryptocurrency community considers almost mandatory. For example, two-factor authentication.   Although it is a hot wallet and therefore vulnerable to online attacks, it lacks two-factor authentication.   It is also not a hierarchical deterministic or multisig wallet. By itself, open source is not sufficient protection for users’ funds.      Since the client is installed on your PC, there is no risk of access by third parties. However, if malware is present on your computer, this can be a potential problem.2     How to import a private key into MultiDoge  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Create a wallet.key file by exporting  \t\t  In order to import private keys into MultiDoge, you must first obtain a file with the .key extension. To do this, you need to create and save a new wallet. Click File -&gt; New Wallet and save. For example, test.wallet:      We received a file with the .wallet extension. But we still need the .key file to import. To create it, you must first export the generated empty wallet (test.wallet) without a password.      Select the Tools -&gt; Export Private Keys tab:     Click the \"Choose export file\" button Choose where to save our .key backup file Be sure to select the \"not password protect export file\" option Finally, click \"Export private keys\".   You will see \"The private keys were exported\":       Go to the folder with the exported .key file and open it with a text editor.

        "title": "Stablecoin USDT&#58; What is it? How does it work? [Explained]",
        "excerpt":"               Can USDT goes to zero? History of Tether Limited.          In this guide, you will learn everything about the Tether (USDT) cryptocurrency.        Theter (USDT) is the most widely used stablecoin and the most traded cryptocurrency in the world.   Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to another asset, most often a fiat currency (for example, the dollar, euro, pound sterling, yuan).   Due to the difficult economic situation in the world, thousands of people began to pour money into crypto. However, cryptocurrency is a highly volatile asset. You can fall into a real “crypto winter”. That’s why people came up with Stable Coin.        Stablecoin is a digital currency pegged to a “stable” reserve asset such as the dollar or gold. Stable Coin in English spelling consists of two words and literally means “stable currency”. Simply put, this is when one “wrapper” is, as it were, equal to one dollar. It turns out the cryptodollar.       And everything would be clear and transparent if the Fed (Federal Reserve System) printed the cryptodollar, like the regular USD. But no. Not only are cryptodollars printed no one knows where and by whom, but countless numbers of them have also been divorced.        We will dedicate this guide to the most popular and muddled cryptodollar on the planet - Tether USD, aka USD.    How does Tether work?  \t \t \t \t\t1 - maintains corporate accounts  \t\t Tether works by keeping traditionally stable assets in corporate bank accounts to keep the exchange rate stable.  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t \t\t2 - guarantees reserves  \t\t \t\t According to Tether, they guarantee almost equal value to the dollar. For example, if a stablecoin is pegged to the dollar, there is a corresponding dollar reserve for each stablecoin issued.   \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \t3 - guarantees the exchange  \t Theoretically, you can exchange each USDT for one dollar. However, not all stablecoins remain pegged to fiat currencies. As mentioned, some stablecoins rely on other mechanisms to maintain the peg.   \t \t  \t \t \t \t  Watch the video: what is Tether (USDT)? \t \t \t \t \t  \tTether USDT is the most widely used crypto stablecoin by individuals and institutions alike. But what is the digital dollar backed by? Tune in to find out.         USDT backed by usd or gold?        Most people are comfortable with the fact that one USDT can be exchanged for one real dollar. Next, we will tell you how it happened and what risks this pyramid has.   How did it happen that in 2015 the capitalization was under a million dollars, and six years later it became under 80?        Many people have a question: where does the money come from?   USDT is printed by a specific legal entity - Tether International Limited. It was established in Hong Kong in 2014. And in theory, we emphasize in theory, this office issues one USDT for one real dollar. And in theory, you can also contribute to this.        The situation is typical: come after the work shift, give 100 thousand regular dollars, get 100 thousand cryptofantiks on your account. And in theory, the opposite is also true: come with cryptofantas, and in return you get real dollars. In such a situation, everything is clear, simple and transparent. One USDT is backed by one real dollar.   Real collateral   But the reality is not as beautiful as the idea.        In fact, USDT collateral looks like 4 categories:      short-term US government bills,   bank deposits and money market funds,   short-term corporate debt and   any other.   There are no questions regarding the first category of stablecoin collateral. These are US Treasury Securities. They are issued by the US Treasury and will only turn to dust if the US defaults1.        The second category is bank deposits and money market funds. The category is also safe, but with a caveat: if we know what kind of banks they are and consider them stable.2        The situation with the third category of collateral is the same as with the second category - it is not known what kind of securities it is. It’s one thing if there are Microsoft bonds, and another thing if it’s from a Chinese developers.        And the fourth category of backing the USDT is literally all sorts of different things. Here are loans to unspecified firms, and precious metals, and even digital tokens. This is an opaque and incomprehensible category.        For easy understanding, these four categories can be divided according to the traffic light principle:     1 - green,   2, 3 - yellow,   and the fourth one is red.        Accordingly, the conclusion is made: the more green in the provision, the safer. The more red, the more dangerous. And now let’s see in what shares USDT is backed.   By the end of last year, the lineup looked like this:        Even closer to our time, the situation is slightly improving: red - a little less, green - a little more.        Here comes the common question:      why do these different types of backing? Why can’t you just keep one real dollar for every one crypto dollar on your balance sheet?         Basically, USDT is a crypto bank. In a regular bank, we invest money on a deposit at interest, and the bank, in turn, tries to lend money at an even higher rate, thus earning on the difference in interest rates.        It turns out that people invest money for free, receiving USDT candy wrappers in return. But at the same time, Tether, of course, also wants to make money on this. Six months ago, investing in reliable assets such as US Treasuries, US government debt or reliable bank deposits, you could earn 0.1% per annum.   Where does the collateral data come from?   Tether has been publishing some reports since 2017. However, this is not a full-fledged bank audit, but rough information, without specifics.   For example, in the seventeenth year, the report looked so that the name of the banks was glossed over3.        More recently, collateral information has been provided by the Cayman Islands office.4   Are these reports transparent and complete? Do they inspire confidence?   Answer: no and no. But other documents for analytics do not exist in the public domain. We work with what we have.   Much more dirty details were found out by the New York prosecutor’s office, which since 2019 has been trying to find out where the money is.        As a result of the audit, Tether was banned from any activity with New Yorkers. They were also forced to pay an $18.5 million fine5. For what?      Firstly, Tether directly deceived by publicly declaring that the money was in dollars in a bank account. In fact, Tether hosted various and opaque instruments. And it was the prosecutor’s office that forced to increase the level of transparency.   Secondly, Tether and Bitfinex tried to hide the loss - $850 million in 2019.   What is Bitfinex?        Bitfinex is a fairly large exchange, owned by Tether International. That is, the cryptodollar USDT is printed by Bitfinex.   The connection with Bitfinex is quite interesting. In November 2018, Tether LTD sent $625 million to Bitfinex6. Why? Because Bitfinex kept one billion of its money in the shady Panamanian pseudo-bank Crypto Capital, which at that moment was having problems with law enforcement in different countries.        Consequently, Bitfinex started having problems accessing the billion placed there. The icing on the cake was delivered by the same New York prosecutor’s office. Quote:      “No contracts or written agreements have been made between Crypto Capital, Bitfinex and Tether7.    It turns out that a billion dollars was sent just like that.   In fact, there’s still a lot more to explore. For the amusement of readers, you can bring the biography of Tether’s chief financier - Giancarlo Devasini. Before the launch of the cryptocurrency, he was a plastic surgeon8.        We note one more thing: it seems to be possible to exchange Tether for a dollar through Tether LTD directly. So this is the fundamental idea. However, at the same time, the owners threw off all responsibility. The official site says:      “Tether reserves the right to delay the redemption or withdrawal of Tether tokens if such delay is due to the illiquidity, unavailability or loss of any reserves held by Tether.9”       “To secure the tokens, Tether also reserves the right to redeem Tether tokens by in-kind redemption of securities and other assets held in reserves.”         Translated into understandable language, it says:      “If we can’t exchange, then we can’t exchange.”         It is understandable, because the equity of Tether is two tenths of a percent. Auditing companies strictly regulate and audit real banks. Although, of course, with themanything happens. Strict Basel III rules force banks to keep equity at least 8 percent of total assets.        This means that even if something happens to eight percent of the bank’s assets and they disappear completely, the owners of the bank, who risked their capital, will bear the brunt. And, for example, those who have invested in this bank will not suffer in any way.   In the case of Tether, their net worth, according to their own reports3410, is 0.2 percent. This is about 40 times less than real banks. Accordingly, Tether holders do not risk anything, unlike USDT holders. Problems could arise even if reserves fell only slightly.   Then why is 1 USDT worth 1 dollar?        Despite all the inconsistencies, deceptions and skeletons in the closet, Tether is quite successfully holding the course one for one.   In the middle of the historical chart, you see a run from 91 cents to $1.08. But since the beginning of 2021, the deviation is negligible. How does this hold happen?        One clear opportunity should be at the forefront - to exchange USDT for a real dollar. It is, in theory, there is, but we personally have not tried. Well, at least because there the exchange and issue is carried out in lots of 100 thousand dollars.        Moreover, people say that not everyone has this opportunity. But the fact that it is provided is for sure. Because if Tether did not give such an opportunity at all, then he would not have existed for 6 years.   Yes, and would not trade on a very transparent American stock exchange Kraken. Moreover, directly in a pair of Tether - a real dollar11.        If one Tether starts to cost 99 cents, then, as a rule, buyers run in. These are either the lucky ones who have access to pay off the Tether directly, or simply market speculators who are confident that the rate will even out.        In this way, they increase demand and bring the price back to one dollar. And if suddenly demand goes off scale, and the price of Tether becomes higher than the dollar, then everything is generally simple. Many speculators will gladly sell cryptodollars for real ones.        Or USDT himself will print and satisfy the demand, thereby returning the price to one USD. And the funny thing is that Tether International itself usually does not need to constantly redeem a huge amount of Tether in exchange for a dollar.        The task of Tether International is to maintain a stable exchange rate. And for this, as a rule, it is enough to periodically redeem only a small share of tokens in circulation, maintaining trust in the system, so that you and I, ordinary hamsters, can exchange dollars through peer to peer12.   Hundreds of thousands of Tethers are exchanged daily for rubles, drams, lari, leaders, tenge, dollars and other currencies. This is because in the minds of the majority, you can exchange this USDT for real money at any exchanger at any time.   Big players exchange millions of Tethers for real dollars in Tether International itself. And so there is no motive to run and repay these wrappers real dollars right now.        This awareness allows you to keep Tether for a week, a month. And who even years. It’s like before people lived with the knowledge that dollars can be exchanged for gold, but no one ran to change crunchy papers for ounces of gold. Well, of course, if not a crisis. A similar situation occurs here.   Is there a risk of scam?   The stability and transparency of Tether is still much less than a dollar. In this article, we also talked about non-transparent reports, about the lack of audit, about companies from the Cayman Islands. All this creates the risk of a bank run. Only not to the bank, but to Tether.        Especially in an environment where there are supply chain breaks, global inflation and at the same time a recession, a global pandemic, climate change. In short, the world is cruel, changeable and unstable. Anything can happen.   For example: most recently, Tether redeemed 16 billion of its candy wrappers for the first time in history. That is, someone came and said:      “here’s 16 billion Tether, give me a real dollar.”         Someone will say: “well, the load subsides.” Another will say: “The bubble is already bursting.” But, as they say, we don’t know the whole truth. It all depends on how badly the security is shattered.   Tether reserves do not have such a large share of doubtful assets - only 15 percent.   It doesn’t look like something terrible. But Tether has since repaid more than $15 billion. That is, approximately 20 percent of all USDT tokens in circulation. At the same time, this kind of redemption, as a rule, is carried out at the expense of the most reliable liquid assets.        In the case of Tether, this is money in bank accounts and US Treasuries, that is, the US national debt. But the most murky assets, such as crypto or loans issued to no one knows who, most likely remained on the balance of Tether.   Accordingly, if the capitalization of USDT tokens in circulation continues to fall as rapidly, then the potential hole in the reserves may well grow from 15 to 30 or even 50 percent of the entire balance. In this case, many people will have big questions about the backing of USDT with real real dollar assets.        For more than 6 years, Tether has been, and still is, a great way to save money, both in terms of its nominal value and in terms of management.   Tether can still be transferred to anywhere in the world, avoiding horse commissions, delays and possible failures.        Risks and nuances are everywhere. Ultimately, it is a matter of your personal financial management.   Summary   There are two extreme points of view. On the left: “we have the future for Tezor”, and on the right: “tomorrow scam. The pyramid will collapse.   Remember that the truth is always somewhere in the middle. We don’t say that Tether is a scam, it has a problem with accountability and transparency, but for six years now it has been a great tool for transferring funds.        But at the same time, the world is changing, different events are taking place. You can’t measure the future by the past. It is necessary to take into account both the international conjuncture and the local one.   Almost every few weeks, a new crypto project for tens of billions of dollars bursts loudly:     Luna/UST   CELSIUS   Three Arrows Capital        Therefore, there will be no forecasts here whether Tether will burst or not, and even more so when. But it can be stated that it is definitely not a pyramid. Just by definition. It does not claim a return on investment.   Tether can be compared to an opaque bank that issues its own derivatives. And banks, even the most honest ones, can also go bankrupt. And for Tether International, in particular, which, thanks to the investigation of the New York prosecutor’s office, there are big doubts, these risks are even more strongly higher.        The MiningSoft.org editors defined it as follows:      We both used Tether and will continue to use it, but most likely only during the day for our own needs. Another thing, tho We won’t keep most of the money in it for longer term storage.    It is necessary to carefully study other stablecoins, but even then there are risks. The ideal does not exist.   We will release a new report with an overview of the rest of the stable cryptofantas.

        "excerpt":"               Yes, Ethereum 2.0 kill mining. But there will be new opportunities.          Exploring Ethereum 2.0 - The Benefits, Mining and Launch Date        Ethereum 2.0 update   When we talk about Ethereum 2.0 or ETH2, there is a key element that characterizes this upgrade. Blockchain said goodbye to ETH mining and implemented on ETH staking.   Ethereum 2.0 has undergone changes - now it is called Ethereum Merge. The process of transition from the old algorithm to the new one is called “fusion”, a fork of the cryptocurrency. There are two independent Ethereum blockchains:      Proof of Work (PoW) - used before the fork   Proof of Stake (PoS) - used after a fork       Let’s briefly recap the basic concepts to move on:      Proof of Work1   An algorithm that allows you to engage in mining, i.e. ensure the operation of the cryptocurrency network using equipment (video cards, ASICs, etc.). This algorithm has been criticized - it uses a lot of electricity, pollutes the environment, etc. Literally: “proof of work” means proof of operation of the equipment.   Proof of Stake2   An algorithm that allows you to engage in staking - receiving rewards for owning cryptocurrency. When staking cryptocurrencies, you earn funds by storing coins or tokens in your wallet. You need to make a contribution for a fixed period of time. Literally: “proof of ownership”.   The Merge   The process of merging the current Ethereum mainnet with the Proof of Stake system (Beacon Chain).3   &nbsp;     mining 1.0 vs 2.0 staking.  In summary, Proof of Work (System 1.0) is a legacy consensus mechanism that allows Ethereum to be mined on GPUs. Proof of Stake is a new mechanism that will allow you to “mine” Ethereum using staking - receiving passive income from placing your assets.   Ethereum vs Ethereum 2.0     Ethereum Energy Consumption Index.  There are the following differences between the two networks:      Efficiency - Ethereum will become 99.95% more energy efficient. It is estimated that 77.53 TWh will no longer be required to secure the network with Proof of Stake. This is the power consumption of the whole country - Chile.45   Sharding6 - the network will be divided into 18 “shards” working simultaneously. This will dramatically increase the speed of work.   Staking7 - Ethereum will switch to a Proof-of-Stake consensus, where everyone can stake assets and help protect the network, earning on it.   Safety. Network discrediting will become much more expensive when using Proof-of-Stake. This will reduce the chance of a 51% attack        Ethereum 2.0 is an update to the Ethereum blockchain protocol that has already been partially implemented. Ethereum 2.0, now called the “consensus layer”, has been in development for several years.   In Blockchain 2.0, the resource-intensive method of mining should give way to the so-called staking method.      In Ethereum 1.0, transactions are verified by solving cryptographic arithmetic problems. For example, the higher the price of Ethereum, the greater the incentive to participate in the mining process. And the more miners involved, the higher the power consumption.   Ethereum 2.0 implemented “Proof of Stake”. This means that those with the most electrical power no longer determine the future of the network. You will be more likely to be selected as a “validator” due to the random mechanism.    BTC vs ETH.  Unlike Bitcoin, when using the Proof of Stake approach, the network accordingly uses fewer resources, but is also less decentralized.    Ethereum Mainnet Merge Viewing Party       Join Bankless, EthStaker, Ethereum Cat Herders, The Daily Gwei, along with many notable guests and the wider Ethereum community as we celebrate the Ethereum network transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake!   Upgrade Dates   Ethereum 2.0 will be launched in 3 phases with the following dates:      Phase 0 - launch of the Beacon Chain network (launched 12/01/2020)   Phase 1 - Merge (completed at 09/15/2022 9:42 AM).   Phase 2 - Sharding (follows after the first phase).   Beacon Chain (formerly known as “Eth2”) is live now. This consensus layer already exists as a separate chain from the existing mainnet (i.e. the “run layer” formerly known as “Eth1”).        The current POW algorithm replaced by a consensus POS protocol on the Beacon Chain network. Therefore, this stage is known as “Merge”. This will also stopped the use of Ethereum mining.     The end of the era of ETH mining.  The Ethereum merge was completed on 09/15/2022 at 9:42 am.   And we finalized!  Happy merge all. This is a big moment for the Ethereum ecosystem. Everyone who helped make the merge happen should feel very proud today. &mdash; vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 15, 2022   However, such a comprehensive change cannot occur on a single key date. Accordingly, the developers decided to divide this change into several phases.   The transition is expected to continue until 2023. However, with the update, developers are addressing two fundamental blockchain problems:     High energy consumption for mining   Problems with scaling due to the small number of transactions.

Simplified ETH 2.0 workflow.  \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \t3. Earn income by protecting the network  \t To maintain the network in Ethereum 2.0, an incentive was invented - the payment of interest for the placement of their assets. Stakers stake assets to validate a new block on the blockchain network. If the block is in error, then the staked amount will be \"cut\". If the block is valid (correct), then the staker will receive back staked assets and an additional reward.   \t \t  \t \t \t \t  Ethereum Merge Release: roadmap, beacon chain and benefits (Explained) \t \t \t \t \t  \tWhat is the Ethereum Merge? What are its economic implications? And what are the main merge risks and misconceptions? You’ll find answers to these questions and more in this video.        What is Ethereum 2.0 - “Merge” and why is it good?   ETH 2.0 is by no means a new cryptocurrency. Technically speaking, this is not even a hard fork, as it was when two different cryptocurrencies appeared as a result - Ethereum and Ethereum Classic (ETC).   Since the term Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2/Eth 2.0 prevails, in this article we will stick to this terminology.   Instead of a new coin, Eth 2.0 describes a series of upgrades to the previous version of Ethereum.    The official name of Ethereum 2 is Serenity8.     Network updates.  This update is good because it brings 3 key features:     Increased network efficiency   Increased throughput   Increased network security   Thus, Eth 2.0 is a description of numerous updates. Therefore, it is important that we take a look at the classic Ethereum that we are familiar with. Then we can understand why this update is happening at all.   Ethereum was created as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps). Using smart contracts, developers can build applications on the Ethereum blockchain.   Since these applications depend on a functioning and efficient blockchain of the platform being used, Ethereum vulnerabilities could lead developers to port their decentralized applications to other ecosystems.   Next, we will talk about exactly which vulnerabilities are involved and why upgrading to Ethereum 2 is so important. And also about the refusal of mining.   Ethereum mining going away   Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest blockchains on the market, have one thing in common - the Proof of Work algorithm. In other words, mining. And this algorithm has a fundamental drawback - mining requires computing power.   A high level of performance requires appropriate energy.     Annual CO₂ emissions according to @digiconomist.ne  The data shows that annual CO₂ emissions alone are 45 megatons, equivalent to all of Hong Kong’s annual emissions.     Transaction costs according to @digiconomist.ne  The network’s annual energy demand is 80.95 TWh. This corresponds to the electricity needed by a US household in 7.03 days.   But the impact on the environment does not end there, because kilotons of electronic waste (video cards, electronic components) are generated annually.   PoW is extremely energy intensive and is no longer in the current “spirit of the age”. The solution is the end of mining and the beginning of the POS era.   Accordingly, the energy-intensive proof-of-work algorithm is replaced by the energy-efficient proof-of-stake algorithm.     Blockchain will stop GPU mining.  On the other hand, sharding is also considered one of the current upgrades. It can be assumed that the Ethereum blockchain in the form in which it exists today will subsequently cease to exist.   GPU Mining after the merge   There is a project claiming to be an Ethereum mining network. EthereumPow is the original PoW-based Ethereum network. It is developed by anonymous developers. Looks like they are from China.     The @ETHW community on medium.  The end of mining is dated September 14-15. The start of ETHW mining will begin with the following blocks:   eth.blockNumber: 15471668 networkid: 0x1 eth.blockNumber: 15471669 networkid: 0x2711 eth.blockNumber: 15471669 networkid: 0x2711   Read more what is ETHPoW (Ethereum PoW) and how to mine it?   Whether to trust the EthereumPow (ETHW) project is up to you. This is outside the scope of our study.   Find out more:   https://medium.com/@ETHW   https://github.com/ethereumpow   https://ethereumpow.org/   There are alternatives to Ethereum mining:     Ethereum Classic   Ergo   Ravencoin   neoxa   Here you can see the list of coins to mine after the ETH 2.0 merge   Automatic change from ETH to ETC for the Merge   Just to do automatic change to ETC when the pool of ETH goes down in the Merge, you need to have lolMiner 1.57+   It is as easy as add etc: like this in the Extra Config:   --pool etc:eu1-etc.ethermine.org:4444 --user 0x85Df244a3C8d6442225360bE681B7F7D803c0e78             That will continue Mining in this case KASPA and continue doing ETC.   It can be used to dual Mine KASPA or ALPH or simple ETC.   In case you want a SSL just add ssl:// before etc:   --pool ssl://etc:eu1-etc.ethermine.org:4444 --user 0x85Df244a3C8d6442225360bE681B7F7D803c0e78   What should be done during a hard fork?   The good news is that the developers are paying special attention to the update so as not to create difficulties for Ethereum users. This means that you won’t have to actively do anything until the end of the update.   There are different scenarios for existing ETH holders:    As long as you are simpleIf you hold, trade or use ETH in your applications, there is nothing you need to do. In this case, your deposits will be automatically transferred to Eth2.    If you want to start staking in Ethereum 2.0, you can already participate. It is possible to join staking as a validator at any time as long as you have 32 ETH to deposit.   What to do if there is no 32 ETH?   You can start staking on Binance exchange from 0.1 ETH.     2.0  Frequently asked Questions   In this section, you will find answers to the most important questions about the Ethereum 2.0 update.                 When will ETH 2.0 be released?                        The release of the 2.0 version took place on September 15, 2022 at 9:42 am (GMT+3).                              How much will Ethereum 2.0 cost?                        According to DigitalCoinPrice analysts, by 2023 ETH could cost an average of $2,274.64.                               What is Ethereum 2.0?                        ETH2 describes a series of updates to the Ethereum platform and its associated cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH). It includes staking, sharding and proof of stake.                 \t          What has changed since Eth 2.0?                          Ethereum 2.0 has changed the way transactions are processed and new coins are created. The project changed the algorithm from \"proof of work\" to \"proof of stake\".                     Why do we need Ethereum 2.0?                        The Ethereum network can no longer handle the load of transactions efficiently. This results in outrageously high commissions. The developers hope this change will lead to faster transactions, lower fees, and a better environmental balance.                              Where to buy Ethereum 2.0?                        Because this is not a new cryptocurrency, you can “buy” Eth 2.0 anywhere you can buy Ethereum. However, while the upgrade is still pending, some crypto exchanges are offering the opportunity to benefit from staking Eth 2.0 right now. Therefore, some exchanges will show you Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0. On the exchanges, your coins will be blocked until the update is completed. Of course, you can also move your ETH to ETH 2.0 by staking yourself.                              Is Ethereum 2.0 a new coin?                        Ethereum 2.0 is not a new coin and will not change the amount of original ETH you own.                              Will I get an airdrop when I fork?                        A fork has been announced that will remain on Proof of Work. This fork creates another coin (ETHW). Any address that previously had ETH will subsequently have ETHW.                               How much are ETHW coins worth?                        This new coin is currently traded in futures. You can see the current price on Poloniex.                              Will I receive coins automatically on Ledger?                        Yes. However, new coins must also be supported by the wallet software in order to be able to access them. But most likely with a few settings it will be easy to access these coins                              And if the coins are on the exchange?                        Further it all depends on whether the exchange supports new ETHW coins or not. Almost all major exchanges have announced that they will be giving away fork coins.                          Will I get a fork if I stake?                        No. Staking coins have no value in the PoW chain.                         What will happen to mining?                        We believe in mining and will continue to look for new opportunities. Several mining hard forks have already been announced. Mining has proven its viability for years.                               How to prepare for POS?                        Update your hardware wallets beforehand. If you keep funds on exchanges, then you do not need to do anything.                               What will happen to ETH payouts from pools?                        Each mining pool provides payout information on their website. Make sure you have time to withdraw funds to your wallet.                              What to mine after POS?                        There are more than enough cryptocurrencies for mining after the transition of Ethereum to the new consensus algorithm. All of them are listed in detailed material on the bytwork.com portal.                              Where to store Ethereum after switching to POS?                        Use only official wallets for storage.

        "excerpt":"               Is Ethereum Staking Profitable?          In this beginner’s guide, you will learn all the details about Ethereum staking and which crypto exchanges and pools support it.        &nbsp;   The process updating Ethereum Merge or Ethereum 2.0 describes the transition of ETH to a new algorithm. New blockchain blocks can no longer be mined. They are created under a special staking contract.   Simply put, staking is a bank deposit with interest. The user transfers funds to the account, stores them and receives passive income for this. The more funds in the account, the higher the earnings. However, the more participants, the less income.            Let’s briefly summarize the main definitions in order to become an expert in this and choose the least risky way to stake:      Staking1   this is the placement of crypto-tokens used in the process of mining new coins. As a user, you keep your crypto tokens but assign them to a staking node that takes part in verifying transactions on the network. You become a validator.   Validators2   these are the nodes of the blockchain that support its operation. They are responsible for confirming and verifying transactions, registering them, and adding new blocks. Simply put, validators are cryptocurrency holders with special software installed on a computer (node).   Nodes (nodes)3   These are the computers running the program (e.g. Ethereum wallet). Nodes are connected to other computers (with the same software installed) to create a cryptocurrency network.   Good and bad ways, risks        There are 4 ways to start staking:     Solo staking (on your PC). Safe because you are in control of your funds. But it’s not easy to set up your own node. You do not share rewards with other services.   Staking as a service. Relatively safe. You need to trust the third-party node operator and pay a percentage for the service. The average difficulty of setting up is because the node is already set up by the service operator.   Staking in the pool. Relatively safe. You need to trust the owners of a third-party pool and give a percentage to the pool operator. However, you can place less than 32 coins.   Staking on exchanges. Not safe. Exchanges are often hacked. Also, exchanges can freeze funds. You can place less than 32 coins. Extremely easy to set up.   When we have dealt with the main theses, we can move on to practice. But first, let’s look at profitability.   Yield   Profitability can be found on the official website of Ethereum4. The CURRENT APR means annual income as a percentage.        It is profitable to engage in staking or not is determined by the number of coins participating in the validation - the TOTAL ETH STAKED indicator. In simple terms, income depends on how many stakers deposit 32 ETH. This determines the possible commission that the validator receives.   Calculation example   Let’s calculate how much profit staking brings in ETH 2.0.   If only 1 million ETH is staked, then you will be rewarded with approximately 5.76 ETH per year (corresponding to a yield of 18.1%). But if 30 million ETH participate in the validation, then the income will be about 1 ETH (3.3%) per year.   In total, if about one million ETH users confirm the validation, the annual income will be about 18.1%, and with 30 million ETH - only 3.3%.        Since actual returns depend on the factors mentioned above, they will also vary greatly in the coming months. However, profits of 3 to 7 percent of ETH can be expected.   It is also important to know that it is not yet possible to withdraw your deposits or profits. This will only be possible after the full implementation of Ethereum 2.0, which is not expected before the end of 2022.   Calculators   There are various calculators on the Internet that show the possible profitability.   List of online calculators:   stakingrewards.com   beaconscan.com   ethereumprice.org   ethscan.org   walletburst.com   Calculate how much you can earn. The results vary depending on the selected amount, term and type of bets.        Hardware requirements   A basic PC with low energy costs is all you need to cut costs and maximize revenue. No need to buy expensive hardware.   According to Prysmatic Labs5, the minimum requirements are:   Memory: 4GB RAM.  Storage: 20 GB free space on SSD.  OS: Linux, Mac OS X 10.14+ or Windows. 64 bit.  Processor: Intel Core i5-760, AMD FX-8100 or better.      Stable internet connection. Your computer must be online 24/76.   Ethereum validator requires 32 Ethereum. However, there are other ways that require less ETH to participate in the staking process.   Above we wrote about 4 possible ways of staking. Let’s consider them all. Let’s start with the simplest - staking on the exchange.    How to stake Ethereum 2.0?  \t \t \t \t\t1. Register on the exchange or any other service  \t\t  In order to stake, you must first register with an Ethereum trading platform. This can be done using website registration form. Fill out the registration form with your email address and a secure password.    Sign up. You will also need to agree to the terms of service and privacy policy. The account will then be activated by verifying the link you receive in your email.  The platform requires identity verification. If you don't want to upload your documents then register on the AAX platform.    Sign up.  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t \t\t2. Fund your trading account  \t\t \t\t Next, you need to replenish your account. With most of the providers we recommend, deposits are free and can be made using the usual methods - credit cards, SEPA transfers, instant transfers and e-wallets.   However, before doing this, you need to know how much fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies you will need to purchase the equivalent amount of Ethereum. This way you calculate the amount of the deposit.     To do this, we recommend that you use the Ethereum 2.0 rate calculator. It can be used to calculate income depending on the number of staked tokens.  \t   \t \t \t \t \t3. Transfer ETH to a staking wallet  \t To do this, open the \"Earn\" tab and select ETH 2.0. After that, click \"Stake now\" and you will be able to participate.     The platform will credit you with BETH, a tokenized asset that represents your ETH in staking at a ratio of 1:1. Binance will credit BETH to your spot account.  After completing the first stage, you can exchange your BETH for ETH at a ratio of 1:1 and receive an amount equal to the current amount of BETH with interest.   \t \t  \t \t \t \t        Staking is extremely simple. It's just 2 steps:   Step 1: You stake Ethereum on Binance Step 2: You'll earn more ETH every day automatically. And as you've seen on my previous videos, I've made a lot of money by staking on Binance and you have been absolutely loving it.  in this video I'll give you the pros &amp; cons of staking Ethereum on Binance and cryptocurrency staking in general. Some people only give you the benefits. Some people give you only about the risks. I'll show you both.  You'll also learn about the ETH 2.0 Merge that is about to happen soon and what does it mean for Ethereum.       Other staking methods include services such as DeFi.   DeFi and services   DeFi are traditional financial instruments built on the blockchain, in particular on Ethereum7.   If you already have your own wallet and store some of your coins on MetaMask, for example, then you have the option of staking Ethereum through DeFi providers.   The most famous example is Lido Finance.   The DeFi provider allows you to stake Ethereum as easily as possible without neglecting the idea of ​​decentralization.    Where to stake ETH? Ethereum Crypto Passive Income (Coinbase, Kucoin, Binance)       How to get crypto dividends by just owning any amount of Ethereum. In this video I show you how to stake your ethereum 2.0 to make crypto passive income.     Pools   Pooling involves staking through centralized online brokers.        The largest pools include the following list:      Lido   Coinbase   Kraken   Binance   Staked.us   Whale 0x5d7   Bitcoin suisse   Stakefish        However, to work in some pools, you will need to deposit 32 ETH. Others work with a deposit of 0.01 ETH        For a complete list of pools, visit beaconcha.in.    Lido Staking Tutorial (ETH, Solana, Matic) - For Beginners       In this video, we cover what Lido Finance is, how to stake ETH, SOL, MATIC etc.   Launching a node on its own   If you have 32 ETH, you can also participate in block validation yourself. However, for this you need a special “non-custodial wallet”.   Such a system is too complicated for beginners, and investments become too risky. Also, unless you hold a significant amount of ETH, the chances of finding a block to validate are extremely low. Given all these nuances, in the following articles, we will look at running a node on its own.   So don’t forget to bookmark miningsoft.org!   Risks        As mentioned earlier, the validator requires unrestricted network availability to work. On exchanges and some services, ETH must be stored in a hot wallet, as proof of ownership must be provided over the Internet at any time.   This is considered a potential risk for attacks. The validator undertakes to store coins from several months to several years. If the price rises or falls, validators will not be able to access their deposit and sell ETH.        In the event of a sharp drop in price, the commission received will no longer be able to compensate for any losses, so staking turns into a loss-making business.   In addition to the potential loss due to a temporary price drop, there is also the risk of losing a depositdue to breaking the rules.   Validators who do not follow the rules can be fined8. Staking Ethereum 2.0 has 2 potential penalties:      Reward reduction.   Partial loss of the deposit.   The reduction of remuneration occurs even with minor violations. For example, if it is impossible to connect to the validator over the network. Partial loss of the deposit usually threatens only in case of serious violations.   These risks include the constant generation of “bad” blocks or careless duplication of transactions.        Moreover, there is another danger, mainly at the initial stage of Ethereum 2.0. There is no absolute certainty that new protocols will be secure, error-free and hacker-proof smart contracts.   To minimize this risk, the developers of the Ethereum Foundation reviewed their code several times with experts. Important components also went through an extensive testing phase.   Pros and cons   It’s time to decide if staking is good or bad?       Benefits:         Remuneration - from 3% to 15% per annum     Ideal for long-term HODL strategies9     You can start with a small deposit          Risks:         Not an easy process, especially launching your own node     Network fines     The need to trust third parties if staking goes through exchanges       Frequently asked Questions                 Where does the income come from?                        Validators collect fees from those who make transactions on the blockchain.                               How much can I earn?                        As with any investment, staking offers the prospect of profit. However, it always depends on the crypto broker you end up choosing.                              How many coins do you need?                        The volume depends on the service. Depending on the online broker, you can stake with a minimum of 0.1 ETH.                              Can I withdraw staked ETH?                        Depending on the provider, you can withdraw ETH from staking, but then you will have to expect the rewards to be lost.                              Can I lose staked ETH?                        Yes you can. Due to network errors, hacks and exchange scams.                \t          How long will ETH be staked?                           You will not be able to withdraw and exchange the rewards you earn through staking until the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is completed. It should take place at the end of 2022 and end at the beginning of 2023.                    Should I stake?   Investing in staking may be suitable for those investors who are looking for a reasonable investment strategy for the medium to long term. These investors can benefit from good returns comparable to dividends.   For this type of investment, as for most others, a positive change in the price of the asset is a prerequisite for making a profit. However, you also need to take the risks that a token price drop can cause.        Opinion of the coindesk platform:     Standing up nodes in multiples of 32 ETH and running them with barely any downtime while the assets are locked up for what could be years won’t be for everyone – and it shouldn’t be.10    On the other hand, traders whothose more focused on day trading or swing trading will not find it particularly advantageous to hold coins for an unpredictable period of time. Your profit is mainly determined by short-term price fluctuations.   However, staking is a reflection of the true evolution in the blockchain network. Don’t you want to be a part of it and benefit at the same time?    The TRUTH About Ethereum Staking Rewards...EARN Passive Income?       A lot of people are saying ETH is due for a dump after the move to POS, but not only do I believe this to be untrue, I believe there is solid passive income to be made. In this video I give you the truth on Ethereum staking nodes, how they work, and what they mean for Ethereum and the crypto landscape as a whole.     Thus, staking is always useful if you want to invest small amounts in a promising investment.

Mining software: PhoenixMiner, lolMiner, NBMiner, GMiner, T-rex Miner etc.        How to mine ETHW?  \t \t \t \t\t1. Get a wallet address  \t\t  You can get a wallet either at MetaMask or on the exchange. Consider both options.  You need to register on the exchange using registration form. Fill out the form with your email address and a secure password.    Sign up. You will also need to accept the terms of service and privacy policy. The account will then be activated by verification via the link you will receive in your email.   Second alternative - get the wallet address in MetaMask.  To do this, go to the official MetaMask website and install the extension:    Loading. This will open Chrome Web Store and prompt you to begin installation:    Installation. You will see a welcome window:    Password. Next you need to agree to the terms:    Conditions. Then MetaMask will ask: do you want to create a new wallet or import an existing one?    import or create. If you want to receive an Airdrop, then use an existing wallet with an Ethereum balance. You can either use a TID phrase or     Password. The wallet will prompt you to create and save a seed phrase:    Seed Phrase. It is imperative to write down these words. Example: tank sphere calm license net film husband category lizard recall energy series   The next step will ask you to confirm the phrase and enter these words. You need to follow the sequence:    Seed Phrase. After confirming the seed phrase, you will be logged in:    Account.     Ethw.    \t\t \t \t \t \t \t \t\t2.

        "excerpt":"         \tHow to create custom routes for specific domains in Linux.              We’ll show you how to use the route command to find the best DNS route for your web server.        &nbsp;   Many Linux users are familiar with the concept of a default route. This is a route that your computer automatically uses when it needs to send traffic to a specific destination. But what about when you need to use a different route for specific domains? In this article, we will show you how to create custom routes for specific domains in Linux.   Some systems prefer certain routes to be used for communications between different parts of the operating system. For example, on a Unix-based system, the default route might be used to send traffic destined for the network interface card (NIC) to the appropriate kernel module.   Knowing which route is being used can help troubleshoot problems.       Stream Hulu with a VPN: Keep your privacy intact   If you’re looking to access Hulu with VPN, keep your privacy intact. Hulu is owned by Disney, and as such, it is subject to a number of restrictions and regulations. These range from requiring viewers to abide by copyright laws to block certain types of advertisements.   In addition, Hulu has been known to engage in data tracking. By using a VPN, you can protect your privacy and keep your browsing activities private.   How To Choose The Right Route For A Specific Domain In Linux?   When choosing a route for a specific domain in Linux, it is important to consider the traffic patterns and requirements of your network. There are several different routes that can be chosen depending on the needs of your network. The following are four different routes that can be adopted when routing traffic in Linux:           Static Route: A static route is defined once and never changes. This is the most common route type used in Linux because it is easy to set up and does not require any configuration on routers or firewalls.            Dynamic Route: A dynamic route is created each time a packet is routed through the system. This type of route can be more complicated to set up, but it offers greater flexibility because it can update automatically based on changes in the network.       To display the current routing table in Linux, run the command:   # ip route      default via 192.168.1.1 dev enp0s3 – default gateway, in this example, working through interface enp0s3. If there is no route for the target address in the routing table, then such a packet is sent through this gateway (default route)   192.168.1.0/24 dev enp0s3 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.201 - static route for the network 192.168.1.0/24 through the address 192.168.1.201, which is registered on the interface   proto kernel - route created by kernel ( proto static - route added by administrator)   metric – route priority (the lower the metric value, the higher the priority). If there are two routes with the same metric (don’t do that!), the kernel starts randomly selecting routes. To find out through which interface (gateway) traffic should be routed to a specific IP address, use the command:   # ip route get 192.168.2.45   How To Find The Best Dns Route For Your Web Server In Linux?   In this article, we’ll show you how to use the route command to find the best DNS route for your web server.   A routed command is a powerful tool that can be used to manipulate network traffic in Linux.   By using the route command, you can determine which packets should be forwarded through your server based on their destination addresses. This can be helpful if you need to configure your server in a specific way, such as routing all traffic for a specific domain through your web server.   To use the route command, you first need to know which domain name you want to route traffic for. You can find this information by querying your DNS provider or by looking at your /etc/hosts file.    GNU/Linux - Adding a Static Route using the route Command (i.e. TCP/IP)       Route manipulates the kernel's IP routing tables. Its primary use is to set up static routes to specific hosts or networks via an interface after it has been configured with the ifconfig(8) program.  When the add or del options are used, route modifies the routing tables. Without these options, route displays the current contents of the routing tables.   route -n route add -net 192.168.7.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.2 dev eth0    Linux Route Add Command with examples        This video explains Linux route add command.

Linux offers a variety of ways to route traffic to specific sites. This can be useful when you need to control how users access certain parts of your site, or when you want to manage traffic load on specific sections of your site.   There are three main ways Linux routes traffic:      via a direct route,   via an indirect route,   and through a proxy server.   Direct routing is the simplest type of routing, and it uses the IP address of the destination site as the source address for outgoing packets.   This approach is best suited for sites that require a consistent level of security and reliability.   Indirect routing involves sending packets through one or more intermediate hosts before they reach their destination.   This approach can improve performance because it reduces the number of hops required to reach the destination site. However, indirect routing can also introduce vulnerabilities if the intermediate hosts are compromised.   System Administrator Trying To Optimize Linux Traffic To Save Bandwidth?   Linux is a powerful operating system that can be used to optimize traffic on a network. It’s possible to route traffic for specific domains through a Linux server in order to save bandwidth.   This type of optimization can be useful if you have a lot of traffic coming from one domain and want to redirect it through your server.   How To Check If A Website Is Running On Linux?   Running a website on Linux can be a great option for those who are looking to save money on hosting costs, or who want to run their site without relying on the third-party domain name and hostname of your website.   If you are using a custom domain name, you can use the route command to reach Queervices. However, in order to ensure that your website is running on Linux, it is important to check your DNS server for the hostname of your site.   If you are using a hosted domain name, you can contact your hosting provider to find out the hostname of your site. Additionally, you can use a web browser extension like WhoIsHostingThis to determine the hostname of your site.   Final Words   It is important to know which route for a specific domain will be the most efficient for your needs. There are many options open to you, so it is important to do your research to find the best option for your needs.  ","categories": ["guide"],

        "title": "Bitcoin&#58; what is it and how does it work (in simple terms)",
        "excerpt":"               What is Bitcoin and why is it needed?          In this article, you will learn everything about BTC. Let’s explain how virtual money works?   What is bitcoin?   Bitcoin is a digital and global monetary system, a cryptocurrency. It allows people to send or receive money over the Internet, even from people they don’t know or trust. This is the first technology of its kind that allows the transfer of a digital asset over the Internet without the intervention of a third party.   Digital money can be exchanged without being tied to a real person. The mathematical field of cryptography is the backbone of Bitcoin security.   Bitcoin is an electronic currency that exists only in the virtual space of the Internet. Also often used is the abbreviation BTC, which is the monetary unit in the Bitcoin system, for which there is a limited supply of 21 million coins1.     Bitcoin is a type of digital currency known as a cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin is the oldest and leading cryptocurrency in the world. The term bitcoin consists of the English words “bit” (digital unit) and “coin” (coin) and means a digital coin. Unlike traditional currencies, BTC does not depend on states and banks.     Just about bitcoin.  To better understand BTC technology, it is important to understand the basic terms.   Important terms and clear explanations           bitcoin   Digital money designed for decentralized payments, that is, transactions without intermediaries such as banks.   Blockchain   Digital chain of records (blocks). Records of bitcoin payments are stored in each block (blockchain).   Cryptocurrency   Bitcoin is also called a cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin payment system uses cryptographic methods to store the information it contains. Cryptography comes from Greek and means secret writing.     How Bitcoin works.     Miner   A member of the Bitcoin network that validates payments and computes new blocks on its hardware.   Mining   The English term “mining” means to dig, mine. When miners confirm payments, they receive new bitcoins as a reward. To add a new block to the blockchain, they need to transfer information from the old blocks to the new one with the appropriate ciphers. This requires computing power and huge amounts of electricity.[21].     How mining works.          Too hard? Simple explanation:    Bitcoin is money. It has value. It is also similar to stocks because its value fluctuates based on supply and demand.    Can I touch a Bitcoin? No, BTC is like the money you have available at banks and credit cards. Money moves from one place to another without even touching human hands.    Who makes crypto coins? To get BTC, you must first mine it. It’s like in a gold mine, only the miners are programs on the Internet.    How can I see how many coins I have? Nobody can see what you have , spend or receive, but the system itself (blockchain) keeps track of the balances. It’s like a big ledger.    How do you store BTC then? In a digital wallet. It’s like an app on your smartphone. Only instead of credit card numbers you have a digital access key. You can evenwrite down these keys and store them in your real wallet.       At first glance, it seems that BTC is different from ordinary money, but in fact there are many similarities. It’s just that bitcoin is more modern and functional than debit cards.   Bitcoin is a digital currency that uses blockchain technology to ensure its security.   Blockchain   Physically, there is no cryptocurrency, there are only special registries that track how many bitcoins someone has and who transfers them to where. These registries are called blockchains.     How the blockchain works.  All purchases, sales and payments in cryptocurrency are stored in blocks of data linked to each other in a chain. This is the blockchain (see terms above). There is a network of people who use their computers to make sure everything is done right. These are miners.   For their work, miners receive new bitcoins. Each participant has a copy of the blockchain stored on their computer. Therefore, fakes are almost impossible.   Blockchain is a complex database, like a giant ledger of individual blocks of information. The trick is that information is shared and stored in a chain of interconnected blocks. This ensures its security and prevents unauthorized access.   The information recorded on the blockchain remains there forever. Nobody can change her.   Bitcoin is not the only thing that uses blockchain technology – many other cryptocurrencies use it as well. And various companies use the underlying technology for non-cryptocurrency purposes.    What is Bitcoin? A simple explanation for beginners       Baffled by bitcoin? Confused by the concept of crypto-currencies? Well, fear no more. In 190 seconds we explain what bitcoin actually is, where the idea came from and the impact it's having around the world. Is bitcoin the future of finance, a potential destroyer of the economy ... or just a silly slice of technical utopianism?   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   History   The inventor of BTC is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym of an unknown software developer or development team). In view of the global economic crisis of 2007, he wanted to provide the world community with an independent transaction system that was cryptographically secure, verifiable and immutable.   The concept and open source software were published between 2008 and 2009 by an individual or group of individuals under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It is still not clear who is behind this.    Mystery Founder Of Bitcoin: Uncovering Satoshi Nakamoto's Identity Of Bitcoin Matters       Experts agree that uncovering Satoshi Nakamoto's identity could have an immense impact on bitcoin's economics and internal politics.   &nbsp;   What is certain, however, is that Nakamoto released the first version of the Bitcoin Core reference implementation in 2009, thereby laying the foundation for Bitcoin, which was the first cryptocurrency in history.   The first goods paid for with Bitcoin were two pizzas in 2010 that cost 10,000 BTC. 10 years later, Bitcoin owners could buy a mega yacht or a private jet for the same amount.   Historical Price &amp; Events   In 2009, the exchange rate of one Bitcoin was about one dollar. In November 2021, the value of the cryptocurrency exceeded $69,000, which is a record high.     BTC price history.   Price history: 2009 - 1$, 2021 - about $69,000, May 2022 - only $27,000.September 2022 - below $19,000.   Volatility means both big rewards and big risks for everyone who owns Bitcoin.    What is The History of Bitcoin: Super Easy Explanation       A short documentary on the history of cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin.   Why is there so much noise around Bitcoin?   The value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed in recent years. Only in the last five years, the cost has increased by about a hundred times.   Anyone who bought BTC with €100 in 2009 is now a multimillionaire. It awakens desires.   Recently, institutional investors and international corporations are increasingly investing part of their assets in Bitcoin. This led to a further increase in prices. But no one can say if this will continue.   The value of digital assets is subject to sharp fluctuations. Therefore, the savings you urgently need should never be invested in digital assets because the price risk is huge. BTC is not a safe investment.   Interesting Facts      Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and hit its all-time high in 2021.   668 million transactions have already been made.   The last coin will be mined in 2140.   About 20% of bitcoins are lost forever. Users have lost their private keys to them.      Private key   is a secure code that allows its owner to conduct cryptocurrency transactions and confirm ownership of their property. Bitcoin keys contain a 256-bit string, displayed as a combination of letters and numbers.    Fun Facts About Bitcoin       We’re sharing our top five fun facts about Bitcoin.      Buying a pizza was the first commercial bitcoin transaction.   There are nearly 100,000 Bitcoin millionaires.   Bitcoins can be bought and put into digital wallets.      Bitcoin wallet   The software is a digital wallet. This is where bitcoins are stored.   In practice, BTC is in the so-called wallet on a PC or mobile phone. They are protected by a very long password. Storing cryptocurrencies on your own device is called “cold storage”. This is the most secure storage method.   Online platforms or cryptocurrency exchanges also offer wallets linked to a user account. These are so-called “hot wallets”, which can be accessed using a computer or smartphone. This is the least secure storage method because the exchange can be hacked.   What does bitcoin look like?   Bitcoin has no coins or banknotes. Cryptocurrency exists only virtually, like a string of digital characters in a computer program.     What Bitcoin looks like.  Virtual currency is fundamentally different from currencies such as the euro or the dollar. Behind the latter are economic powers and central banks that provide security and stability. Bitcoin does not have this, which ensures that it is not tracked or protected.   Advantages      Cryptocurrencies are available worldwide and operate independently of states.   Blockchain technology is considered very secure.   The basis is a decentralized database, a blockchain stored on several computers and managed jointly by the participants. All transactions are protected from forgery using cryptographic methods.   Unlike classic money, the new coins are notare issued and not controlled by a central authority such as a central bank, but are created and managed decentralized through cryptographic computing on the network.   Unlike classical currencies such as dollars or euros, an unlimited amount of BTC cannot be created. There is a limit of 21 million. Most of the coins have already been created.        In addition, the internet currency is considered to be inflation resistant as its absolute amount is capped at 21 million. This was also the goal of the inventor Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym for an unknown software developer or software development team).   In view of the global economic crisis of 2007, the creator wanted to provide the world community with an independent transaction system that would be cryptographically secure, verifiable and immutable.   Safety   Payment transactions are carried out and protected using the blockchain. This means that other participants in the Bitcoin network are of central importance. Many other computers on the network participate in the payment transaction, making the encryption very secure from manipulation. For providing computing power, the rest of the participants again receive bitcoins - this is how new bitcoins are created.   Criticism   Volatility   The price of bitcoin is considered unstable, volatile2. This means that it is subject to strong fluctuations.   The price of bitcoin fluctuates much more than stock prices. In November 2021, one bitcoin was worth $69,000, in May 2022 it dropped to $27,000. This is a difference of more than 50 percent.   Bitcoin is a digital currency, there is no real value behind it, as, for example, is the case with gold. In addition, BTC is not a national currency.    The Dangers of Bitcoin - Analysing Risks Ahead For Bitcoin In 2023       Before you buy bitcoin, or tell someone else to do so, make sure you understand these fundamental risks.    Shadow market   Critics believe that criminogenic elements use bitcoin to trade drugs or weapons. Hackers blackmail companies by shutting down computer systems and demanding a ransom in bitcoin. You can buy bitcoins anonymously. This is why digital currency has always been so popular among criminals.   However, following this logic, cash is also used to trade in drugs or weapons. This does not mean that cash should be banned.   High risks   Bitcoin has a reputation for being a non-transparent object of speculation, rather than a convenient, independent, and widespread means of payment. Some people have become very rich because of this - in fiat money like euros and dollars - others have lost a lot of money.   If law abiding citizens want to use Bitcoin, this is not possible anonymously due to government regulations, and a normal bank account is usually required, so Bitcoin is not independent of banks and governments.   Other disadvantages      As a result of hacker attacks on large crypto platforms, amounts of several million euros have disappeared.   Cryptographic verification of transactions in the blockchain and the creation of new coins require gigantic power consumption.   It is estimated that the global bitcoin network consumes as much electricity as Sweden in 2022.   If you lose the private key to your virtual wallet, then digital money will be lost.   Future hacker attacks cannot be completely ruled out.   There are no contracts and legal guarantees.   If the Internet collapsed, then the digital currency could no longer be used.                 21 million bitcoin limit &#8617;                  What is volatility in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies &#8617;           ","categories": ["articles"],

        "title": "What is Crypto Mining? How Does It Work [explained simply]",
        "excerpt":"               What do mining farms calculate?          In this article, you will learn what cryptocurrency mining means.   What is mining?   New bitcoins are generated in a process called mining. This process is complicated, but in simple terms, mining is when computers solve mathematical equations, and as a reward they receive bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.   The term “mining” means “digging”, i.e. creation of new coins. This is done by the so-called miners, who, in the case of bitcoins, add the next block to the blockchain and collect a reward for this. Blockchain is a ledger that keeps track of how many bitcoins someone has and who transfers them to where.     What is mining in simple words.  Important terms and clear explanations           Mining   The process of mining cryptocurrency using the power of computers. Calculations are carried out using specialized integrated circuits (ASIC)1 or video cards (GPU). These devices solve complex problems (hashes). At the same time, a new block of bitcoins is found, for which miners receive a reward.   Mining farms (mining rig)   Powerful high-performance computing rigs for mining, occupying a significant amount of space. Several devices are combined into farms to make them easier to maintain.   Miner   A person who mines cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency mining software itself is also sometimes called a miner.     Mining definition.  The idea for the name of the process of creating new cryptocoins arose from a comparison with gold miners looking for gold in mines.   In English, the term “mining” refers more to the extraction and extraction of valuable metals in mines and tunnels.   Comparing cryptocurrency mining with gold mining, the name becomes clear. In both forms of mining, miners perform work and are rewarded in the form of an uncirculated asset. Along with digital gold, natural gold is also mined from the ground and becomes part of the economy.     Comparing cryptocurrency mining to gold mining.  How does it work       When using cryptocurrency, transaction details are recorded in the so-called blockchain (registry). The miner is tasked with solving the complex problem behind this transaction. The process ends when the miner confirms the legitimacy of the transaction. Once this is done, the transaction will be visible to everyone on the blockchain.     How mining works.  Simply put, it is about solving complex mathematical problems. Therefore, the transaction verification process requires miners to use high processing power.   The more miners involved in the verification process, the faster the transaction is confirmed. For conducting such a transaction, the miners receive a part of the transaction as a commission. Each successful transaction generates additional new coins that are put into circulation on the blockchain network.     The mining process and transactions.  What is calculated?   Mining farms are engaged in the calculation of “hashes” according to a given algorithm for cryptocurrency. These hashes are mathematically calculated sequences of letters and numbers stored in blocks.   The most famous cryptographic hash functions used in cryptocurrency algorithms include “SHA-256” in Bitcoin, “Ethash” in Ethereum Classic, “Scrypt” in Litecoin.     Mining process.  Calculating hashes   A Bitcoin block contains hashes, which store the hashes of previous blocks, as well as transaction details.      hash   A hash in the Bitcoin blockchain is a fixed length of a unique sequence of random numbers containing data of any size. Each hash is unique, so you can’t look at a hash and guess what data it contains.   To understand the complex nature of a hash, consider an analogy: every Bitcoin hash is like asking someone to flip a coin 160 times and write it either heads or tails. In the case of heads or tails, there are only two variables on the coin. However, with numbers and letters, the possibilities of a 160-character Bitcoin hash are endless. There will never be two identical values.     What is a hash.  In a hash puzzle, the resulting fingerprint is a list of characters (let’s call it a word), for example, “cat”, after which your task is to find the desired “fingerprint” of this word. To do this, all you can do is try all possible combinations of numbers (of a certain length), one by one.   Hashrate and hashing   To summarize the information above, a hash is a randomly generated alphanumeric code, and hashing is the process of guessing that code. Hashrate here is the speed of mining, hashing (solving the puzzle).     Hashing is a method of generating a fixed size output from a variable size input.     Hashing   transformation and generation of input data of any length into a fixed-size string, which is performed according to a certain algorithm. Specifically, the Bitcoin hashing algorithm is SHA-256 or 256-bit Secure Hashing Algorithm.   Hashrate   A measure of the processing power per second used in mining. Simply put, this is the speed of mining. It is measured in hash units per second, which means how many calculations can be performed per second. Machines with high hashing power are very efficient and can process a large amount of data per second.   Here it becomes obvious that the more powerful our hashing machine (aka mining farm), the faster we will find a solution to the algorithm and get income.   But powerful devices will immediately find all Bitcoins, right? No, there is a complexity parameter in the algorithm for this.   Network complexity   Mining difficulty is how difficult it is to find a given hash below the target value.   The target value is recalculated every 2016 blocks, with the mining difficulty being inversely proportional to the target value.   As mining difficulty increases, the target value decreases, and vice versa.   In simple terms, for beginners, it is about solving complex mathematical problems. Therefore, the transaction verification process requires miners to use high processing power.     Network complexity  As mining speed increases, mining difficulty also increases. As a result, the speed of block creation is reduced to the desired 10 minutes, as mentioned earlier. All this is described in the Proof of Work2 algorithm.   Once the mining difficulty increases, the average mining time returns to normal and the cycle repeats approximately every 2 weeks.   Equipment and Requirements   Mining uses the processing power of a video card (for some cryptocurrencies, a processor) to mine coins such as Monero or Ethereum Classic.   There are also ASICs specially designed devices, such as Bitmain and Antminer.     An ASIC chip is 1000 times more efficient at mining than a chip in a home PC.  Cryptocurrency mining requires a special GPU (Graphic Processor Unit) designed to solve complex equations inlittle time. If you want to start crypto mining without your own hardware, so-called cloud mining farms are available.   What is better ASIC or mining farm   Initially, the creators of Bitcoin planned to mine it on the central processing units (CPUs) of widely used laptops or desktop computers. However, ASICs have outperformed both processors and graphics cards (GPUs) due to their lower power consumption and higher processing power.   Thus, ASICs are better than processors and video cards in mining. They are more powerful in terms of processing power. They can process much more data per unit of time.   Ultimately, more and more miners with high computing power will be more successful than smaller home miners.     Device performance table.  The performance hierarchy is as follows:      CPU - The central processing unit of the computer. The lowest efficiency.   GPU - Graphics processor (video card). Average efficiency.   FPGA - Integrated Circuit. High performance.   ASIC - Application Specific Integrated Circuit. Top performance.      Pools   Mining rigs allow miners to harness the combined processing power of multiple machines, channel it into mining pools, and distribute a reward (share) for each successfully mined block.    What is Bitcoin Mining? How Does It Work?       Mining is done by running extremely powerful computers (known as ASICs) that race against other miners in an attempt to guess a specific number.   The first miner to guess the number gets to update the ledger of transactions and also receives a reward of newly minted Bitcoins (currently the reward is 6.25 Bitcoins).    Mining methods   There are different approaches to cryptocurrency mining. Here are the 4 most popular types, ranked by the degree of simplicity.       Mining methods:    Cloud mining. As the cost of acquiring GPU or ASIC miners is getting higher compared to revenues, cloud mining farms are becoming more and more popular. Cloud mining allows individual miners to take advantage of large corporations and specialized facilities. With a cloud solution, you can rent cloud hardware for a specific period of time.    CPU mining. In the early days of technology, CPU mining was the easiest way to start mining. To start cryptomining, a simple home PC with a good processor was enough. However, mining on processors is too slow and does not bring that much profit, if you take into account the costs of electricity and cooling.    GPU mining. Several GPUs, so-called video cards, are combined into a large mining farm, which increases the processing power used.    ASIC mining. Unlike GPU miners, ASIC miners are specifically designed for cryptocurrency mining, so they can produce more units of cryptocurrency than GPUs. However, the acquisition costs of such ASIC miners are many times higher than those of GPU or CPU miners.      ASIC farms are used for bitcoin mining.   What cryptocurrency is being mined? All coins with the proof of work algorithm can be mined on farms. And mining rig3 is part of the farm.     12 GPU mining rig  Mining is not profitable?   It is said from time to time that mining is dead. There are several factors at work here. Even if the miners are profitable, you must consider upfront costs such as hardware purchases and ongoing electricity costs. Only when all the costs are calculated can one see if it is profitable.   The benefit also depends on the type of equipment. For example, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service, a hash rate of 14 terahashes per second can be obtained either from a single ASIC miner with a power of only 1800 watts, or from more than half a million 40 megawatt Sony game consoles.    Best ASIC Miners For Mining Cryptocurrency In 2023       ASIC miners are specialized computers that only mine crypto, they are oftentimes as powerful as 100 or more GPUs?!   &nbsp;   Halvings and rewards   Bitcoin rewards are halved every four years. This is a process known as halving4. Therefore, miners must become more efficient and faster in order to maintain a constant profit.      When Bitcoin was first released in 2009, a miner was earning 50 BTC per block.   By 2012, the reward was 25 BTC per block.   After Bitcoin halved in 2016, the reward was halved again to 12.5 coins.   The reward is currently 6.25 BTC per block.   The next halving is expected at the end of May 2024. Then the block reward for miners will be halved to 3.125 BTC.   In the protocols of many cryptocoins, a halving formula has been introduced. This is important to take into account when calculating.   Power consumption   You can use various online profitability calculators to decide if mining is profitable for you based on electricity cost, device efficiency, mining time and currency value.   According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the energy demand of the global Bitcoin network is about 90 terawatt-hours. This currently corresponds to about 0.4 percent of the world’s electricity.   By comparison, air conditioning systems in the US alone last consumed about 2,199 terawatt-hours. This is more than 24 times the energy requirement for global bitcoin mining.     Bitcoin electricity consumption  The BBC estimated Bitcoin’s electricity consumption to be higher than in Argentina (121 TWh), the Netherlands (108.8 TWh) and the United Arab Emirates (113.20 TWh) and is gradually approaching Norway (122.20 TWh). ).5   Proponents, on the other hand, see more benefit in mining: they argue that mining can protect the power grid from fluctuations or failures. To maintain the power grid, a certain voltage must always be maintained.   Yes, the energy demand for bitcoin mining is high and will continue to rise as the number of miners increases. But network security will also grow.   According to the Bitcoin Mining Council6, almost 60 percent of the energy needed for global Bitcoin mining already comes from natural sources such as wind or solar energy: this share currently stands at 58.9 percent.   What happens when mining ends?      The maximum supply of Bitcoin is rigidly defined and will never exceed the limit of almost 21 million coins7. Thus, the supply of BTC cannot be expanded.    Because of the halving, the last bitcoin won’t be mined until around 2140. According to the analytical company Coinmarketcap8, there are currently just over 19 million coins in circulation. This means that it will take miners at least 117 years to mine the remaining two million coins - that is, for the remaining ten percent.   Law   Crypto mining itself is completely legal, but some crypto miners use malware to obtain cryptocurrencies in an illegal way.   This scam is called cryptojacking. These are programs used to covertly search for digital currency on hacked computers.   Conclusions   Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, that is, neither a central bank, nor a central database, nor a single central authority manages the monetary network. Cryptocurrencies do not have a central authority. Rather, they are run by the cryptocurrency community and, in particular, by cryptocurrency miners.    GPU mining is dead?       The yield isn't there to compensate for the price declination. Its pretty much a nail in the coffin for home miners.   &nbsp;   Miners add transactions to the blockchain. Different cryptocurrencies use different generation methods, if cryptocurrencies use mining at all. (Most cryptocurrencies do not use mining.)   Various mining and consensus methods are used to determine who creates new blocks of transactions and exactly how blocks are added to the blockchain.   Question answer                   Which cryptocurrency should I mine?                           A promising historical coin rate and low mining difficulty are the most important criteria if you want to mine cryptocurrency.                  \t  Who Invented Mining?                         Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto was the first miner. Information is circulating on the Internet that before the start, he managed to secretly get a big fortune. However, these are just rumors. According to official information, Satoshi was only able to mine 750 coins.

        "title": "Decoding the Decade Ahead&#58; A Peek into the Potential Future of Bitcoin",
        "excerpt":"               The future of Bitcoin          In this article, you will learn about the prospects of bitcoin.   The future of Bitcoin, the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency, is a topic of much speculation and debate. In the decade since its inception, Bitcoin has gone from being a niche asset to a household name, but what does the next 10 years hold for this innovative technology?   We’ll take a look at some of the key factors that are likely to influence the future of Bitcoin and provide some insights into what we might expect to see in the coming years.                     Founder       Satoshi Nakamoto                       💰 Coin       BTC                 🎬 Start       03/03/2009                 🛍️ Max. quantity       21,000,000 bitcoins                 🔮 emission       18.925.00 BTC                 🥇 current rank       #1                 📝 White paper       BTC Whitepaper           Scalability   One of the key challenges facing Bitcoin is scalability1, the ability of the network to handle increasing numbers of transactions as more people adopt the technology.   Over the next 10 years, it’s likely that the Bitcoin network will need to continue to evolve and adapt to handle the growing demand.   One potential solution is the implementation of the Lightning Network, a second layer payment protocol that enables fast and inexpensive transactions without overwhelming the main Bitcoin network.   If this and other scalability solutions are successfully implemented, it could go a long way in paving the way for wider adoption and growth of Bitcoin.   Regulation       Another factor that could significantly impact the future of Bitcoin is regulation2.   In recent years, regulators around the world have begun to take a closer look at cryptocurrencies and many countries have introduced new laws and regulations to govern their use.   While some argue that too much regulation could stifle innovation and limit the potential of cryptocurrencies, others believe that sensible regulation will help to protect consumers and prevent criminal activity.   The next 10 years are likely to see continued debate over the best way to regulate cryptocurrencies, and the outcome of this debate will have a significant impact on the future of Bitcoin.      Institutional Adoption   In recent years, we’ve already seen a significant increase in institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. From investment banks and hedge funds to pension funds and endowments, more and more traditional financial players are starting to allocate resources to cryptocurrencies.   This trend is likely to continue in the next 10 years, as institutional investors become more comfortable with the asset class and seek to diversify their portfolios.3   The entry of institutional investors into the market could help to bring greater stability and credibility to the cryptocurrency market and increase demand for Bitcoin.   Technological Developments   The world of technology is constantly evolving, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. Over the next 10 years, we can expect to see continued innovation and development in the cryptocurrency space, including the emergence of new technologies and use cases.   For example, the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is already having a major impact on the cryptocurrency market and this trend is likely to continue.   As technology continues to advance, it could open up new opportunities for Bitcoin and help to drive its growth and adoption.      Competition   Although Bitcoin is currently the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency, it’s far from the only one.   Over the next 10 years, we can expect to see continued competition from other cryptocurrencies, including new entrants and established players.4   Some of these competitors may offer faster, cheaper or more secure alternatives to Bitcoin, and could potentially challenge its dominance. However, Bitcoin has a significant head start and a strong network effect, which could give it a competitive advantage in the years to come.   Conclusion   The future of Bitcoin is uncertain, but there are several key factors that will influence its trajectory in the coming years, including scalability, regulation, institutional adoption, and technological developments.   The next 10 years are likely to be a period of growth and evolution for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.   While it’s impossible to predict exactly what the future holds, Bitcoin has already come a long way since its creation in 2009 and has the potential to continue playing a significant role in the financial world.   It’s important to do your research and understand the risks and potential rewards before investing in Bitcoin. You should also read through articles on price prediction to equip yourself with the necessary knowledge.   With a calculated risk, Bitcoin can offer growth potential and a unique opportunity to participate in the emerging world of cryptocurrencies.   The world of cryptocurrencies is rapidly evolving, making it worth keeping an eye on for those who are seasoned or just starting out in investing. The right approach could lead to growth and wealth creation in the future.

Blockchain is a database that is not centrally located in one place, but distributed across many computers. The most important task of a blockchain is to securely document digital transactions. The technology has become famous thanks to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum.   Simply put, a blockchain is a decentralized or distributed database (also: distributed ledger). This means that it does not reside with one person or organization, but exists as a complete copy on a large number of computers.     What is blockchain in simple words.

Mining   The process of mining cryptocurrency using the power of computers. They solve complex tasks by validating the blockchain network. At the same time, a new block of bitcoins is found, for which miners receive a reward.   As the name suggests, a blockchain is a aggregation of blocks of data. The easiest way to illustrate this approach is with an example. To do this, we use the Bitcoin cryptocurrency:     Blocks in the blockchain.  Simply put, a block of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum can be compared to an Excel spreadsheet that has the following structure:                  User A (sender)       User B (recipient)       transaction amount                       bc1ql2qw7ujlpn27hat32nklptsyytff30ys8wpj96       bc1qhs3gptkxem5y7yaq2yg0un2m8hae6wt87gkx4n       0.0518814 BTC                 bc1qrpp7g75sx3ejclvsfdw2uahzchtyu7vumkuadu       bc1q4s0vsp6gpc2aqt0cvd703hxy5jv93d76mra2mf       0.0002813 BTC           The contents of the first two columns are the anonymous addresses (hash) of the sender and recipient of the corresponding transaction. With each transaction, the table (block) is supplemented with the next row. When a certain number of lines (size) is reached, the block is closed, sealed and filed. Then the next block starts.   Over time, numerous blocks are created that line up: the blockchain. The more blocks in the blockchain network, the higher the security. These blocks are created by miners.     Explanation of blocks of blockchain technology.  The big difference between a regular database and a blockchain is decentralized storage. The technology works with a network of computers and servers that store each individual block in parallel.    How the blockchain is changing money and business. Don Tapscott       What is the blockchain? If you don't know, you should; if you do, chances are you still need some clarification on how it actually works. Don Tapscott is here to help, demystifying this world-changing, trust-building technology which, he says, represents nothing less than the second generation of the internet and holds the potential to transform money, business, government and society.   Don Tapscott, Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute, is one of the world’s leading authorities on the impact of technology on business and society. 1    How the technology works       Let’s explain using Bitcoin as an example. Think of blockchain as a ledger. Users of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency initiate transactions by buying, selling or paying with currency. As with an account, these movements must be recorded so that others can understand the transactions.   As a result, no one loses sight of how much Bitcoin has been bought and sold. Therefore, the computers involved create a block for transactions containing all the necessary information. The block is attached to the blockchain - the registry, expanding it. Computers encrypt the block using a complex algorithm.     How blockchain works.  Here is an example of how the technology works:      Buyer A buys bitcoins from buyer B.   The blockchain network recognizes the booking and combines it with other cryptocurrency transactions into one block.   All computers participating in the network now calculate the encryption algorithm.   After the algorithm is generated, the computers coordinate and add the encrypted block to the block chain.   All computers participating in the network keep the same block.   Transaction completed.    What Is Blockchain and How Does It Work? In 7 Minutes Explained       This Blockchain video will help you understand what led to the creation of Blockchain, what Blockchain is, how a Bitcoin transaction works, how Blockchain plays an integral role in it with feartures like hash encryption, proof of work and mining and how Blockchain technology is used in real life scenarios. Now, let’s dive into this video and understand the basics of Blockchain and How Blockchain works.   Application, implementation in business   Blockchain technology is the modern and best form of doing business. It removes layers of “bureaucracy” and friction. Blockchain also eliminates the need for businesses that provide services related to checking and certifying goods, guarantees, and registering/recording a transaction in a public registry.   This means that all related jobs (accountants, sales representatives, lawyers, and other office administration workers) and businesses that have traditionally served these needs are a thing of the past.2     blockchain use cases.  Blockchain can be applied to the following business areas:      Retail   Transport   Logistics   Management   Finance   Services   Banking   Healthcare   E-commerce   Insurance   Entertainment   Energy   Sports   Real estate   Which business will kill blockchain   Blockchain is needed where the speed and reliability of data transfer is important - that is, in almost all areas of life: when concluding smart contracts for the supply of goods, buying and registering real estate, logistics. This technology enhances the trust, security, transparency, and traceability of data exchanged across a business network.     What kind of business will kill blockchain.  Banking and payments   One of the most famous use cases of blockchain is financial transactions. First of all, cryptocurrencies illustrate how this technology can be used in the financial world.       How is blockchain better than traditional banks?  It uses encryption. This is done using the hash function and protects data from hacking and manipulation.    In the process of using the blockchain, individual transactions are verified and distributed among the so-called nodes (miners, validators, network participants). This results in a high level of data consistency and a particularly high degree of transparency. These properties are the basis for banking operations.     Transactions on the blockchain.  This principle opens up interesting applications for international payments. Since verification takes place internally, intermediaries can be eliminated and transaction costs can be reduced. The absence of intermediaries also ensures faster transaction speeds.   Healthcare   The healthcare sector is also showing that blockchain can definitely offer benefits. It can be configured so that only selected users have access to stored data (assets).   In particular, personal documents such as patient records, medical reports, and disease progression can be stored on the blockchain. Access to this data is provided only to selected users who were previously recognized as the owner of the data.     Blockchain healthcare use case.  Identity and personal data management   Identification is a complex task in some business areas. However, with the help of blockchain technology, people’s identities can be identified more safely and quickly than before.   This is based on extensive databases that allow identification and verification. In particular, existing identity documents — driver’s licenses, passports, and ID cards — can be securely implemented digitally. Manipulation would also be virtually impossible.     Identity management  Data leakage will also be prevented as the data is stored in a decentralized manner.   Insurance   Modern blockchains offer the possibility of developing smart contracts. These are intelligent computer scripts that automatically initiate transactions on the blockchain.    Smart contracts on the blockchain.  The results are predetermined in the contract and depend on the actions of the parties involved in the smart contract. When both parties fulfill their obligations, the smart contract will know what action to take next. 3   For insurance companies, smart contracts offer great added value because, above all, the processing of claims for damages or insurance payments can be displayed automatically and securely.   Supply chain   Logistics advantages can be obtained by creating simpler contracts and constantly tracking the relevant goods.     blockchain in supply chain example.  Thus, the food supply chain will be completely transparently documented from the point of origin to the final supermarket. This is where the advantage of distributed data processing offered by blockchain becomes apparent.    Blockchain in Supply Chain Management? Applications, Advantages, Examples and Trends       The use of blockchain in supply chain management is still in its early stages, but there is great potential for this technology to streamline supply chain processes and improve transparency and traceability.       For example, blockchain could be used to track the movement of goods throughout the supply chain, from the point of origin to the point of sale. This would allow all stakeholders to see where the goods are at any given time and make sure that they are being handled properly. Additionally, blockchain could be used to verify the authenticity of goods, ensuring that only certified, safe products are being sold.4    Manufacturing   The option of distribution of access rights also plays a key role in manufacturing. In addition, the technology can document the ownership of an item and is suitable for use in this area.     How is blockchain changing manufacturing?  With distributed ledger technology, it will be possible to use the vehicle/equipment when needed and pay directly for the service used.   Energy   The energy market is also undergoing constant changes. Blockchain technology is preparing to increase the transparency of this market by making transactions traceable.     What is the future of blockchain in energy industry?  For example, the billing of private solar systems can be optimized in this way. Such positive regulation could accelerate the announced energy transition.   Within the framework of electromobility, billing for electronic charging stations can also be implemented in this way and the actual payment process can be ensured.   Voting system   Blockchain technology can also be used in online elections. The base system will be considered a neutral space. Voters could take part in elections without fear of manipulation.     Blockchain voting system.  In this way, each voter can also keep track of their vote and check if it was counted correctly. Faking or changing the voice is also not possible.   Certification   Educational qualifications such as references or certificates are the backbone of professional life and some people rely on fakes to get certified by a well-known specialized institution.   Using the blockchain, institutions, universities and technical colleges are able to issue diplomas and certificates that cannot be counterfeited. They will be protected by a private key and recognized internationally.   Thus, official certification and sending of original documents will be excluded.    Blockchain Expert Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty       Blockchain, the key technology behind Bitcoin, is a new network that helps decentralize trade, and allows for more peer-to-peer transactions.   WIRED challenged political scientist and blockchain researcher Bettina Warburg to explain blockchain technology to 5 different people; a child, a teen, a college student, a grad student, and an expert.5   Advantages   Top 10 Benefits of Blockchain Technology:      Transparency.   Reducing transaction costs.   Flexibility.   Faster transaction settlement, decentralization, user-controlled network.   Distributed architecture.   Openness.   Automated operations.   Efficiency, auditability, traceability.   Safety.   Worldwide implementation.     The Benefits of Blockchain  Thus, the blockchain can guarantee the accuracy and security of data records and create the need for third-party services.6   Disadvantages   Top 10 disadvantages of blockchain technology:      Low performance.   The problem of scalability.   Some blockchain solutions consume too much energy.   It is difficult to correct an error or make adjustments - the data is unchanged.   Not completely safe.   High cost and implementation difficulties.   Expert knowledge required.   Users must keep private keys.   Young technology, little implementation experience.   Low compatibility with old databases.     Disadvantages of blockchain.  Conclusions   Blockchain technology still has potential. However, the required computing power, high power consumption are the subject of criticism. PTherefore, numerous developers are working on improvements.   So far, the decentralized database has impressed with its transparency, speed, and security.   The technology can be used in all areas of business. Above all, transparency, decentralization and security play an important role. Many companies are already discovering the possibilities of the technology and developing their own products based on the blockchain. Many experts see great future potential in this technology, so developments in the coming years are likely to be particularly interesting.    Blockchain technology embraced as tool for social good       From bitcoin to NFTs, it feels like blockchain technology is everywhere. But beyond making the already rich that much richer, can it also make society more fair?   Question answer                   Who checks the network?                         Validators, like miners in a Proof-of-Work (PoW) network, are network nodes that operate on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, and also verify blocks of transactions in the blockchain.                                  Where is transaction data stored?                         Blockchain data is stored in a decentralized public ledger. Ledger data is stored in chunks called blocks, which are linked to each other using cryptography.

        "title": "What is banned content in Russia?  (Censorship)",
        "excerpt":"              Roskomnadzor censorship on the example of bitcoin.          In this article, you will learn about government blocking and how to solve this problem.   In August 2022, the largest website about cryptocurrencies, mining and blockchain - bytwork.com was blocked by the Roskomnadzor (RKN), the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media.   Legal:      The basis for inclusion in the register of the information specified in paragraph 2 of this article is, among other things, a court decision that has entered into force on recognizing information disseminated via the Internet as information whose distribution is prohibited in the Russian Federation (paragraph 2 Part 5, Article 15.1 of Federal Law No. 149-FZ).1    In plain language, the basis for blocking was information about Bitcoin and its acquisition.   The essence of the blocking: in 2020, the Onega City Court ruled to block the site bytwork.com without notifying the site administrators about the court, although there was such a possibility (the mail was indicated in the site footer).   For 2 years (from 2020 to 2022), the matter went to Roskomnadzor, and only in August 2022 the department blocked the site.   &nbsp;   Received a notification from representatives of the department:      The government notice proposes to remove material allegedly infringing the law. Otherwise, it will be included in the list of prohibited information.   What to do after blocking?       The Bytwork team initially tried to handle the whole process on their own. They removed the page because of which there was a court and notified representatives of the department about it.   However, Roskomnadzor considered that the entire domain is subject to blocking. And despite the fact that the administrators of the Bytwork site removed the page against which the judgment was issued, RKN left the entire domain blocked.    Block type: entire domain, not article.  Next, Bytwork turned to lawyers. Not all lawyers understand how to conduct such cases, moreover, many did not understand what blocking from the RKN is and who blocks access to sites in Russia?   The Bytwork team realized that it was necessary to look for lawyers specializing in such cases!   According to numerous reviews and advice from administrators and owners of other sites-colleagues, the company DRC.law was found.   DRC.law is a large company of IT lawyers. They solve all legal issues for users, website owners, IT and Telecom businesses!      Contacting DRC.law, Bytwork immediately outlined the issue. The lawyers instantly, thanks to their vast experience in handling such cases, described a possible solution to the blocking problem, drew up an action plan and honestly set the deadlines (let’s say right away that DRC.law did everything quickly and efficiently, all the deadlines depended only on the Court, post offices and other related to this).   After listening to the action plan, the Bytwork team decided to cooperate with DRC.law.   Solution   The DRC.law team immediately proceeded to create an appeal based on the fact that Bytwork was not notified of the trial and the procedural deadlines were violated.   It should be noted right away that DRC.law gives you a choice of 2 options for working with them:2      You personally go to court with lawyers;   You draw up a power of attorney for the company (it is only for the court), and the lawyer himself goes to court on your behalf. Bytwork chose option 2!   Since the court was very far away, it was easier and more profitable to issue a power of attorney.   After the appeal was drawn up, it was sent to court (everything was done very quickly). The appeal was sent in August 2022! And the answer from the Onega City Court came already October 10, 2022.   Note that the letter came to the Bytwork team at the specified home address and in parallel to the legal address drc.law.    Notice that the state has accepted the appeal.  Further, only November 1, 2022 the case goes to court!   The appeal was considered for about 2 months, after which the date of the new hearing was set for 12/21/2022!   Second hearing?   On December 1, 2022, right before the new year, the Bytwork team gets a great message from the lawyers:      “Hello! The lawyer wrote that the decision of the Onega city court was canceled in the part of the bytwork website and the case was sent for a new trial to the court of first instance. Next, we are waiting for the case to be sent to the court of first instance and the appointment of a court session.”    AND:      “An important point, at this stage, after receiving the appealsionic determination, we can submit a request to the RKN and the site will be unblocked “    Everything is great, and we are very grateful to drc.law for the work done, but the matter is still not fully resolved, because:      “However, the case is not closed, because the issue of blocking depends on the second session of the first instance”    So, the new hearing will take place on February 3, 2023!   But until that moment, lawyers from DRC.law wrote a letter to the RKN to unblock the site (since the case in which we were blocked by the RKN no longer existed). And thanks to their letter to Roskomnadzor on January 23, bytwork.com was already unblocked!   Victory!   On February 3, 2023, the Bytwork team receives the following letter from attorneys:      “Hello! I have great news: during the meeting after the break, the prosecutor announced that he was dropping his claim regarding the requirements for bytwork. The refusal was accepted by the court, the proceedings were terminated. So everything ended well.”    That’s all! The Bytwork team won the case thanks to the lawyers from drc.law! They advised and accompanied Bytwork throughout the case!   Huge thanks to:   Inna Tverezovskaya.      And Anna Kuznetsova      They handled our case and answered all our questions in detail!   Question Answering                   What should I do if the site is blocked by Roskomnadzor?                         Submit an application to eliminate content violations to Roskomnadzor via the official website of the department  or by writing a letter to zapret-info@rkn.gov.ru. Or just contact lawyers.                                  What is banned content in Russia?                         All content that, in the opinion of the authorities, is contrary to local law. Roskomnadzor is directly involved in maintaining the Register of banned sites. It sends lists of prohibited resources to communication providers. If access to the site is restricted in Russia, equipment supplied by Roskomnadzor telecom operators will detect and block this request.                                  How does the government block websites?                         Roskomnadzor enters a domain name, website IP address or address of a specific page into its registry - a “black list”. Data from this registry is regularly downloaded to their equipment by all Russian Internet providers. In this case, the agency is obliged to notify the domain administrator about the blocking.                                  list of things banned in Russia                         On its own initiative, Roskomnadzor can block websites for the following reasons:  pornography; information about how drugs are produced and consumed; information about methods of suicide and calls for it; illegal information about violations against children; information about illegal gambling; information on how to buy alcohol and drugs remotely; information harmful to children.  Source: Bases for blocking web pages.                                  How do you check which websites are blocked?                         You can check the blocking through a form on the department's official website.

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Explained - What is It, Types, Pros & Cons [2023]",
        "excerpt":"               Learn all about the potential of cryptocurrency and what it means for the future.          This article breaks down what it is, how it works, what types of cryptocurrency exist, the pros and cons, and use cases. Learn the basics and understand cryptocurrency simply!   Definition   Cryptocurrencies are encrypted digital currencies that are created and stored electronically. They can be spent like regular money, but can also be used to buy and sell other digital currencies.   Virtual money has no material equivalent and is a record in a special database (blockchain). The base is very reliable, and the technology built on it, perhaps, gives humanity even more value than the coin itself.                 How do you explain cryptocurrency to a beginner?  Simply put, cryptocurrency is digital money created from code using mining farms or validators. The balances of the owners are stored in the ledger (register), which is distributed on many independent computers. This means that the blockchain registry does not belong to one person or organization, but exists as a complete copy on a large number of devices.   When a new transaction is made, it is verified by every computer in the blockchain network and then validated. This makes any falsification almost impossible.     Definition.   Is there a physical cryptocurrency?  Think of cryptocurrency like owning a piece of land. You may not physically own it, but your ownership is recorded in the local government ledger. In the event of a dispute, you can enter your name on the ledger as the registered owner to prove that you bought and own the land.   Only in the case of digital assets, you do not need to confirm the ownership in the local government or in the bank.   Decentralization rules everything here, not banks.   Important terms and brief explanations        What does decentralized cryptocurrency mean?      Decentralization   With decentralization, no one person or group has control - instead, all users collectively retain control. Decentralized blockchains are immutable. This means that the entered data is irreversible.   Decentralized   The term means that the decision is made at different nodes. Each node determines its behavior, which ultimately affects the behavior of the entire system. This ensures that no node has complete system information.     Decentralization.  Cryptocurrencies are actively implementing decentralized and distributed systems in their favor. All popular digital assets have these characteristics.       Principle of operation      Main article: How Blockchain Works in Cryptocurrency and Other Industries     Let’s take a look at how cryptocurrencies work. Digital currencies run on the blockchain. It makes transactions with virtual currencies especially secure. You can think of it as a log containing every cryptocurrency transaction. To protect against attacks, transaction data is distributed decentralized across multiple computers (nodes) that form a peer-to-peer network.     How it works.  Several transactions are combined into an encrypted data block. If it is full, it closes and can no longer be changed. Block by block, a chain is created that exists in the same way on all computers on the network. If someone tries to manipulate the chain on one of the computers, they will be blocked.   Mining: how blocks are added to a blockchain      Main article: How mining works     To process, secure and synchronize the growing number of transactions on the network requires huge computing power. If you lend your computing power to this “mining” process, you will be rewarded with coins. However, mining consumes a huge amount of electricity - as much as the Netherlands in a year.   New coins are generated in the process of mining, i.e., deciphering the tasks for issuing coins.     Mining.  In this way, coins are created by a network of participating users (miners). They are needed to decrypt cryptographic tasks for issuing tokens and coins.   Transactions in progress are checked for validity by thousands of computers on the network, verified and stored in a decentralized manner.   Usage   Cryptocurrencies are designed to operate as independent, decentralized and cryptographically encrypted payment systems. The goal is to create better and more secure means of payment. Unlike official currencies, most cryptocurrencies are decentralized and usually limited in number. Some of them can also be used anonymously.     What is a cryptocurrency for?  Cryptocurrency is needed for:     Access to personal finance,   conclusion of smart contracts,1   use of the Internet of things,   digitization of metals,   stablecoins,   crypto money can be traded on special exchanges or through crypto brokers.     Application of cryptocurrency.  In general, the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment is declining and banned in some countries.   Several companies accept payment with bitcoins. In most cases, online payment is accepted. Restaurants, cafes and shops are the exception rather than the rule. To be able to pay at the checkout, a corresponding QR code is usually required.    Cryptocurrency in 5 minutes - explain crypto to complete beginners       This video on Cryptocurrency covers all the important concepts from basics to advanced.   Types      Main article: How Bitcoin works     Bitcoin is the most famous of the virtual currencies. Since it was developed in 2009, its cost has skyrocketed. If you had bought Bitcoins for little money then, you would be a millionaire today.2       What are all the different types of cryptocurrency?    Classic cryptocurrencies on the blockchain that change their value as a result of the interaction of supply and demand . Examples: bitcoin, ethereum.    Stable coins with a certain fixed value - the rates never change here. For example, Tether USDT.    Tokens - coins that do not have their own blockchain. They exist as part of an ecosystem of another network.    Meme coins - comedians of the crypto world. These coins are gaining popularity thanks to memes and social networks.3   Alternative coins (altcoins).        Difference between coins and tokens.  Altcoins   Contrary to what the name might suggest, altcoin is not one single cryptocurrency that bears that name. The “ALT” part of the word does not refer to any one new virtual currency such as “BIT” in Bitcoin. The word “alto” comes from the word “alternative”.   Altcoin refers to all cryptocurrencies developed after bitcoin.   Thus, altcoin is an alternative to the first digital currency. For example, Ethereum is considered an altcoin.     What is an altcoin.  Cryptocurrency can be called an altcoin only if certain requirements are met, which BTC also has. This requirement is simply called: blockchain. Only cryptocurrencies that are also based on the same technology as Bitcoin can also be called an alternative to Bitcoin.   This point is important for distinguishing an altcoin from a cryptocurrency.   Promising   In the years since the first bitcoin transaction in 2009, thousands of additional cryptocurrencies have emerged, creating a confusing environment for investors. Some of these altcoins feature major technical innovations that set them apart from Bitcoin, while others have simply become popular digital currency brands and social media memes.   Cryptocurrency investing remains highly speculative, but it can be highly lucrative for investors willing to take risks in the hope of big payouts.4   Ethereum (ETH)   The next major digital currency after Bitcoin is Ether. On the Ethereum network, you can enter into smart contracts, that is, digital contracts that come into force after the contractual agreement is fully fulfilled.      On the market since 2015.   Much more environmentally friendly due to the update Ethereum 2.0.   Uses its own blockchain.   Traded as the leading currency after bitcoin.   Ripple (XRP)   Banks love this cryptocurrency because the payment network works with them and speeds up international bank transfers. Mining is not required - all coins have already been generated. There are 100 billion XRP in total.      On the market since 2012.   Considered a classic bridge currency.   Price fluctuations in the cent range.   Litecoin (LTC)   Bitcoin’s little brother, the efficient Litecoin blockchain can generate more blocks and therefore process more transactions in less time.     Promising and popular altcoins.  IOTA   This network is designed for IoT applications (Internet of Things) and allows transactions between machines or devices. In the future, you can use it, for example, to pay for charging an electric car or to protect e-health data. There are many large companies on the side of IOTA. Instead of a blockchain, there are nodes and a graph system. The project becomes faster and more secure with every connected user.   Cardano (ADA)   The network wants to fix the first problems of other cryptocurrencies by combining their advantages. The project is easier to scale, conduct faster transactions and provide even greater security.      Created in 2015 by the co-founder of Ethereum.   More focus on sustainability and interoperability.   Any scalability.   Encryption.   Considered a new generation of cryptocurrencies.     Sometimes you can hear that some altcoins are called tokens. In this case, the term is correct if the altcoin is built on the platform of another coin. For example, tokens Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC) or SHIBA INU (SHIB) exist on the Ethereum platform.   Tokens   It is not easy for beginners to recognize the difference between cryptocurrencies and tokens. Tokens are digital assets that are embedded on other blockchains and do not have their own blockchain to run and operate. For example, many of the most popular tokens in the crypto space are built on the Ethereum blockchain and are often referred to as ERC-20 tokens.     Differences between tokens and cryptocurrencies  Tokens can represent an asset, such as digital art, or provide the holder with a specific service or application access.   Nft tokens   NFT (English non-fungible token - “non-fungible token”), also a unique token, is a digital entity that represents a specific physical or virtual object in the blockchain, which makes it unique. You can think of it as a painting by a famous artist. No matter how many copies or reprints there are, the original is always unique.     What are NFTs and how do they work.  As digital proofs of authenticity, NFTs can display any virtual or real object on the blockchain.   NFTs are best known for the hype surrounding digital art such as GIFs and memes. A reworked version of the popular cat cartoon “Nyan Cat” has been auctioned for the equivalent of around 500,000 euros.5   Meme coins   Meme coins are cryptocurrencies based on a meme - an Internet joke that has become popular. It doesn’t have a purpose behind it like bitcoin wants to make the global financial system fairer.6 They were made for fun.   Memecoins are a group of cryptocurrencies that have no intrinsic utility or function, but simply act as a kind of funny currency. The first meme coin was Dogecoin, which started as a parody of Bitcoin. Many investors showed great interest in the fun currency, and over time, the price has risen significantly.     What is a Memes Tokens.  Stablecoins   A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the price of another asset, hence the term “stable”. For example, a dollar-pegged stablecoin should always be valued at 1 USD if it functions properly.7   Tether is a classic example of a stablecoin. The rate remains always stable one to one to the dollar. The circulation is controlled by the company issuing it - Tether Limited and the Bitfinex exchange.     Stablecoins: definition, how they work, and types  The table provides comparisons of stablecoins with digital assets.                  Cryptocurrencies       Stablecoins                       Traded algorithmically and without reference to any other currency       All stablecoins are always pegged to different assets (fiat currencies, commodities, etc.).                 Great growth opportunities       Lower volatility to trade and store value                 High volatility       Suitable for hedging crypto profits                 High risk of losing everything       Cheap money transfers abroad are possible                         Better accumulate interest                         No Growth Opportunities Like Traditional Crypto Assets           Comparison with fiat money   Fiat currencies, also “Cash” are traditional, paper money that everyone is used to. These currencies are only valuable because the regulators say so, and because the people who use them still believe in their value. Fiat money like dollars can be used to exchange for goods and services.   Let’s compare fiat currencies and digital ones.     Comparing cryptocurrency to fiat money                 Cryptocurrencies       Fiat currencies                       Brand new       Well established                 Can be used anonymously       Not anonymous                 Have no limits of use       Limited by borders                 Without inflation (limited release)       Subject to inflation           Advantages   Cryptocurrencies, and even more so blockchain technology, can lead to improvements at a fundamental level with the approach to decentralization in various economic and social areas. As a result, entire sectors of the economy can be turned inside out in the long run. Traditional systems will no longer be needed.   The main advantages are the storage and transport of all information in a tamper-proof and fault-tolerant manner.     The Benefits of Digital Assets  Disadvantages   In addition to the numerous advantages of cryptocurrencies, the risks cannot be neglected. Moreover, a beginner in the crypto world needs to carefully understand both the advantages and disadvantages.   The following theses are usually attributed to the disadvantages of cryptocurrencies:      Low liquidity compared to traditional financial instruments.   Strong price fluctuations.   Possible total loss of funds or data.   Due to the lack of regulatory mechanisms, there are no guarantees for the safety of electronic crypto wallets.   Loss of a password to an electronic crypto wallet or its inoperability leads to the irretrievable loss of all coins.   The developers of some digital assets are partially unknown and are engaged in deceiving users. You should be attentive to the crypto project, study it.     Top 5 disadvantages of cryptocurrency  Risks   A serious risk to consider is that billions of dollars worth of digital assets have been stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges over the past few years.8     Risks  Therefore, it is extremely important to beware of unlicensed platforms and only buy cryptocurrency from a regulated exchange or broker, of which there are not many. If you want to store your cryptocurrencies in your own wallet, there are fewer risks.   It is possible to unequivocally answer the question: is cryptocurrency good or bad by summing up the advantages and risks.                  Features / benefits       Risks / disadvantages                       Decentralization       Volatility                 Transparency of all operations       No clear regulation                 Flexibility in use cases       Often there is no real solution to the problem                 Protection against unauthorized access       High consumption of resources and energy           Despite the disadvantages and risks, you should not hope for the collapse of cryptocurrencies.      “Bitcoin, however, will not disappear because it is in fact decentralized and is still in high demand as a replacement for obsolete money by individuals, corporations and nation states.” - Samson Mou, CEO, JAN3    Law: bans and adoption   Regulation in most countries, which is mostly just beginning, is a risk that should not be underestimated when investing.   In addition to supporters, there are a number of opponents of cryptocurrencies. States like El Salvador feel their chance to become more independent of the dollar. Other states, such as China, are fiddling with their own digital money and have driven mining out of the country and banned trade.9   The amount of energy or computing power required for mining, including the required hardware, and the high energy consumption of each transaction is a thorn in the side of many government officials around the world.     Countries that have banned or restricted the circulation of cryptocurrencies  On the other hand, there are supporters who see digital assets as a great opportunity for their country and are determined to follow this trend so as not to miss the stage of technological development, as was the case with the Internet and the so-called FANG shares. (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google).   Even among supporters, the picture is divided. Some see more regulation as a positive thing, as it will build confidence. The other side insists on decentralization and anonymity at all costs.   A general and worldwide ban is in doubt. Partial regulation is likely to have a negative impact on the whole situation, at least in the short term, but then may clear the way for institutional investors and thus pave the way for the very broad masses.   Therefore, a definitive declaration of a general ban is not possible.   What Is crypto Backed By?   Cryptocurrencies are not backed by real assets or tangible securities. They are traded between the parties by agreement without a broker and tracked in digital ledgers.10 The rate is not backed by anything other than actual supply and demand.   At the same time, the cryptocurrency is provided by the value that the users of the Network give for it, reliability, limited emission and a number of other factors. According to many analysts, they have an even greater impact on the stability of the monetary system than gold and foreign exchange reserves.   What Determines Price?   As a general rule, if the stock market crashes, then the cryptocurrency market crashes with it. There are also influencing factors, such as the legal regulation of cryptocurrencies, which is still largely open.   The reasons vary, but it’s still worth taking a look at Bitcoin’s price history since its inception and cycles of the huge ups and downs that accompanied it.     Bitcoin price history  Sometimes there are sharp and unpredictable price fluctuations. It is impossible to say why the rates rise or fall. This represents a potential risk for investors. Due to the high volatility, investors are quicker to sell these high-risk investments.   How does crypto make money?   Cryptocurrencies allow you to earn money in various ways:      Trading speculation in cryptocurrencies or CFD contracts.   “Reward” for doing various work on the network   “Winning”   Crypto lending and staking   Investment   Airdrops and forks   Mining     Cryptocurrency earning options  Trading   If you buy cryptocurrencies and the price rises, you can sell them and make a profit. It sounds very simple. However, for beginners it is important that theymore thoroughly dealt with cryptocurrencies. For example, not all digital currencies are equally suitable for trading and earning.     Trading options  Contract Trading (CFD)   It is important to decide in advance whether you want to buy cryptocurrencies or want to trade CFDs without buying cryptocurrencies yourself.   Contracts for difference (CFDs) are derivatives that allow you to bet on how the price will develop. CFDs exist on stocks and other real assets, as well as cryptocurrencies.   Remember that CFDs are very risky. Depending on what price action the bet is on, whether the price goes down or up, you can make a mistake and lose.   Crypto lending   Crypto lending offers the opportunity to earn interest by lending your cryptocurrencies. This can be done on peer-to-peer lending platforms, some crypto exchanges, and through so-called DeFi, decentralized financial applications, among others.   Investing   Investing is a long-term strategy for buying and holding crypto assets for a long time. Cryptocurrency assets are usually well suited for a buy and hold strategy. They are extremely volatile in the short term but have huge upside potential in the long term.   Staking   Simply put, staking is like a bank deposit with interest. The user transfers funds to the account, stores them and receives passive income for this. The more funds in the account, the higher the earnings. However, the more participants, the less income.   Mining   Crypto coins are generated in a process called mining. This process is complicated, but in simple terms, mining means that computers solve mathematical equations and receive bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies as a reward.11   Airdrops and forks   An airdrop is a process by which a company distributes its tokens to the wallets of specific users, completely free of charge, in order to stimulate brand awareness.   Why would companies just give away their tokens? This is an effective way to get fast network usage and create hype around new blockchain based business. This acts as a way to reward investors and clients.   Some companies may use Airdrops for technological reasons, such as for a hard fork.   A hard fork occurs when changes are made to the code that create two paths for a project to develop. This is exactly what happened with Bitcoin Cash (BCH). After the fork, all BTC holders received BCH.   Conclusions   To sum it up, it is important to do a thorough research, both in terms of the cryptocurrency you plan to add to your portfolio, and in terms of the exchange or broker you are opening an account with.   Cryptocurrencies are not a form of investment with safe interest rates. Still, earning on cryptocurrency is possible. If you are willing to take on a high risk with this type of investment.   Cryptocurrencies are an incredibly exciting trend that is no longer a dream of the future. Large profits are possible, but extensive knowledge of the financial market and investments is required.   Before diving into the crypto adventure, you should collect a lot of information, which is also described on the MiningSoft.org resource. Then you are more likely to celebrate successes rather than mourn losses.    How Cryptocurrency actually works. How are cryptocurrencies created?

        "title": "Blockchain project design&#58; principles, concept and architecture",
        "excerpt":"              Human-Centered Design: trust, simplicity at the Core          There are a few things to keep in mind when designing for blockchain while keeping it simple.   Introduction   Blockchain. Even the mere name of it brings up mental pictures of mathematics, cryptography, and nodes, the digital currency that enables smooth, quick, and safe transactions.   But how does any of this relate to design? You must first understand the underlying ideas of blockchain in order to design for it. Here, we list the four main guidelines for blockchain design.   What is Blockchain?   You must comprehend blockchain in order to design for it. The existence of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum is made possible by blockchain technology.   It is fundamentally a distributed ledger where transactions are openly and chronologically recorded. Each transaction is then saved on a block of data that is difficult to tamper with after being cryptographically confirmed by network nodes.   Even though Bitcoin and Ethereum employ different forms of blockchain technology, they have several things in common. The decentralized nature of blockchain is the most striking comparison. It stores transaction information independently of any central authority.   A group of interconnected computers form the blockchain network, which receives copies of the blockchain and verifies transactions to preserve the integrity of the ledger.   As a result, there can be no single point of failure, and the system cannot be altered or controlled by a single entity.   Blockchain technology is most often used by Crypto, which is presumably how you first heard of the term. However, the technology can be used for everything from financial transactions to keeping track of medical information and more.   The name “blockchain” refers to a system where data is stored that cannot be altered.   The ability of blockchain technology to support decentralization is its other side, in addition to the fact that it makes cryptocurrencies possible.   Blockchain decentralization moves decision-making away from a centralized place or authority.   Decentralization increases an organization’s efficiency and effectiveness by getting rid of pointless components, cutting down on duplication, and preventing single points of failure. Members of decentralized networks are meant to act independently without seeking approval from the centralized grid.   Three fundamental network structures—centralized, decentralized, and disseminated—are frequently employed when considering a technology setup.   Although decentralized networks are typically used by blockchain technology, a blockchain application may or may not be decentralized. Decentralization should therefore be implemented further up the grid and at both the technological and administrative levels.   Therefore, it is crucial to keep design principles in mind when working on a product that supports decentralization.   Blockchain Design Principles to Follow   Design and development of fintech apps has been gaining ground quickly. Here are the three blockchain design tenets that you ought to abide by. We’ve limited it to just three because designing for blockchain and cryptocurrency projects is more about understanding the technology, its intended audience, and the future blockchain brings than it is about adhering to the rules.   Human-Centered Design   The most important aspect of blockchain is that users must have faith in it. Blockchain must be created in a way that is clear to all users in order to gain their trust.   Therefore, one of the most crucial aspects of blockchain design is how user-friendly it is. Giving people who may not be extremely tech-savvy basic, intuitive user interfaces is one method to do this. If you are looking for an example, you can download bitcoin trading app for iPhone made by CEX.iO   Designing for Trust   Designing for the blockchain entails planning to create a service or application that can be relied upon, is unchangeable, and is (nearly) completely transparent to all users and stakeholders.   The fundamental function of blockchain is the handling of private data. Therefore, it’s crucial to keep the user’s trust when it comes to that information1.   Reliability and stability of the platform are affected in some way by that trust. To preserve user confidence in your design and product, pay attention to customer feedback and maintain consistency.   Simplicity at the Core   Make your application as simple and easy to use as possible. Blockchain creates an almost endless stream of data and information, so keeping your interface simple will make it easier for people. This also helps diminish entrance barriers to your platform. The less a user has to figure out, the easier it is to start using.   With that said, there are a few things to keep in mind when designing for blockchain while keeping it simple.      Security –Even with 2FA, users should have no trouble entering their login information (a secure password or biometrics). More importantly, every page, file, and transaction must encourage a sense of security while maintaining the design’s simplicity and navigability.   Additionally, security shouldn’t be equated with resistance. You want a platform that makes every interaction feel safe and secure.           Privacy –Some degree of privacy is necessary for sensitive information. Users desire privacy for their identities as well as for their activities on your platform. No matter what your product does, pseudonyms and private keys are two blockchain technology cornerstones that you should incorporate.            Transparency –It takes time to complete a blockchain transaction, but we rarely know exactly how much of that time is related to network utilization. Users ought to know about their own transactions because the data is sensitive. Maintain your users informed when designing and keep transparency in mind.       For people to understand how your product functions and how it differs from those of your competitors, a transparent governance approach is also crucial.      Consistency – Establish one design language, and use it as much as you can. It enables consumers to move through your product with ease, pinpoint their location at any given moment, and decide what steps to do next. If the user interface of your blockchain project is clear, uncluttered, and adheres to a single design language throughout, it will be more successful.

You can transfer data to Excel and edit it.     Export data.  Remote control   Enabling “Remote Control” allows you to fully control the miners remotely. To do this, select your miner in the list, press the “Remote Ctrl” button and enable the API. You will also need to enable “Power Fast Boot” in order for the miner to start up quickly (important if you are into mining).     Remote control.  The following options are available here:      Reboot - reboot the device.   Mining Control - start/stop mining.   Performance Mode - select hashrate mode:   High Normal and Low.   Fast Boot Switch - speed up startup.   Miner API Switch - use the API interface to get different states of the miner and change parameters.   Restore DHCP - restore dynamic IP (DHCP) settings.   Leds Control - determine the location of the miner by giving a light signal.   Protection Mode - SSH mode.   Restore Factory Setting - restore factory settings.   Adjust Freq - miner overclocking control.   Export Log - export the device operation log. The log includes files: upfreq_test.log, power.log, Miner.log, system.log and api.log.   Web Pools Switch - configure pools through a web interface.   Troubleshooting   Can’t see ASIC   Try the following steps:      Switch the Internet port on which the asic is from 100 megabits to 10.   Try a different version of the app.   Change your router.   If you connect the device directly to a computer, the Internet Sharing service must be enabled. Then the ASIC will receive an IP address from the computer via DHCP.   Also do the following steps:      Check if the running computer is on the same network as the miners.   Check the status with the alarm LED.            Network port signal: yellow always on, green flashing.       Restart the miner and find the IP address again.       Reset the miner (press the “RESET” button for 3 seconds until the red-green light flashes). Then find the IP address again.

        "excerpt":"               Important aspects to consider when choosing a trading platform          Make sure that you consider the above factors to choose the best automated cryptocurrency trading platform.   In the cryptocurrency industry, trading has become popular due to its benefits. Crypto trading involves buying and selling digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and altcoins.   Traditional trading methods require constant monitoring, which can be time-consuming and overwhelming for a non-professional.   That’s why you should consider using automated cryptocurrency trading platforms such as Immediate Edge.   Using these platforms will make it easier for you: they use the best trading strategies and allow you to change the settings. However, you have to choose the best one as some of them offer not the best services.   Research  Before joining the crypto trading industry, it is crucial to do your own research. Check the reliability of the potential platforms you plan to use.   Look for user reviews, expert opinions, and the history of the platform. Understanding the algorithms and strategies used by an automated trading platform will help you make informed decisions.   Transparency  Transparency distinguishes reliable platforms from fraudulent ones. A reliable automated cryptocurrency trading platform should provide clear information about its operating methods, risk factors, and historical performance.   Be wary of platforms that promise guaranteed profits but don’t provide information on how to make them.   Supported Exchanges  Check if the automated trading platform supports various cryptocurrency exchanges and how wide the range of coins is. A versatile platform expands your trading opportunities and minimises restrictions.   Diversification is a key strategy in crypto trading, and a platform that offers multiple options is invaluable.   Customisation  A reputable automated trading platform should offer customisation options that allow you to adjust your trading activity to suit your goals.   Look for a platform that allows you to set investment limits, profit targets, and stop loss levels.   Customer Service  Automated crypto trading can be complicated. A reliable platform should provide solid customer support. This includes easily accessible help with technical issues, account queries, and clarifications.   Effective customer support ensures that you are never stranded at a critical trading moment.   Expenses  When evaluating automated cryptocurrency trading platforms, consider the costs involved. Some platforms charge a subscription fee, while others deduct a percentage of your profits. Look at the commission cost structure and make sure it fits your budget and trading frequency.   Remember that quality often reflects reasonable cost.   Security  Security is important in the world of cryptocurrencies. A reliable platform should prioritise the safety of your funds and sensitive information. Look for platforms that implement good security measures such as two-factor authentication (2FA), encryption, and cold storage of your assets.   Community and resources  Consider platforms that offer more than just automated trading. A strong community and educational resources can expand your trading knowledge and skills.   Discussion forums and tutorials can provide information and help you stay abreast of the ever-evolving crypto trading industry.   Regulations and Compliance  Cryptocurrency trading is regulated in many regions. To avoid legal complications, choose platforms that comply with the necessary regulations of the country you are in.   A platform that adheres to legal standards reflects its commitment to ethical and responsible trading practices.   Trial Period  Many reputable automated cryptocurrency trading platforms such as Immediate Edge offer trial periods. Take advantage of this opportunity to familiarise yourself with the platform’s interface, features and performance.   This is a risk-free way to determine if the platform meets your trading goals.
