        "excerpt":"               All About LolMiner: Tuning For Maximum Profit.          This page describes how to get started mining with lolMiner 1.24a and newer.   Download for Windows / Linux   Download releases from GitHub   Download from BitcoinTalk   Setting up   To set up a batch file, we need to enter three commands:           set \"POOL=eu1.ethermine.org:4444\" - specify the pool address   set \"WALLET=0x360d6f9efea21c82d341504366fd1c2eeea8fa9d.lolMinerWorker\" - specify the wallet address and farm name (any)   lolMiner.exe --algo ETHASH --pool !POOL! --user !WALLET! timeout 10 - we leave the standard command to run and the algorithm.   This is how the lolminer batch file for eth will look:   @echo off  setlocal enableDelayedExpansion  Rem ################################# Rem ## Begin of user-editable part ## Rem #################################  set \"POOL=eu1.ethermine.org:4444\" set \"WALLET=0x360d6f9efea21c82d341504366fd1c2eeea8fa9d.lolMinerWorker\"  Rem ################################# Rem ##  End of user-editable part  ## Rem #################################  lolMiner.exe --algo ETHASH --pool !POOL! --user !WALLET!  timeout 10   lolminer nicehash batch file   lolMiner.exe --algo ETHASH --pool daggerhashimoto.eu-west.nicehash.com:3353 --user 3HHG3zpxP4AmbKDR9iRy1c2bqAb4WKhNwm.worker --tls 0 --ethstratum ETHV1 pause   This is the second, easier way to specify a batch file:        And an explanation:           lolMiner.exe - the name of the program that will be launched   --algo ETHASH - algorithm name   --pool daggerhashimoto.eu-west.nicehash.com:3353 - specify the pool address and port   --user 3HHG3zpxP4AmbKDR9iRy1c2bqAb4WKhNwm - specify the wallet address from Nicehash   .worker - after the dot we indicate the name of the worker (any name)   --tls 0 - specify the TLS type (leave 0)   --ethstratum ETHV1 - specify the type of protocol Stratum   A finished example:   lolMiner.exe --algo ETHASH --pool daggerhashimoto.eu-west.nicehash.com:3353 --user 3HHG3zpxP4AmbKDR9iRy1c2bqAb4WKhNwm.worker --tls 0 --ethstratum ETHV1   Commands   To start mining with Lolmeiner, you need to specify three things, namely:      mining algorithm   pool address or solo address to connect   username / wallet for mining        Configure the algorithm for mining   LolMiner has two ways to specify the algorithm you want to mine. You need to choose one of them to start mining.   The first option is --algo (-a) followed by one of the following algorithm names:                  BEAM-I       BeamHash I                 BEAM-II       BeamHash II                 BEAM-III       BeamHash III                 C29D       CuckarooD 29                 C29Z       CuckarooZ 29                 C30CTX       Cuckaroo 30 Cortex                 C31       Cuckatoo 31                 C32       Cuckatoo 32                 EQUI144_5       Equihash 144/5                 EQUI192_7       Equihash 192/7                 EQUI210_9       Equihash 210/9                 ZEL       ZelHash           Note that you can always find out the supported algorithms with the command: lolMiner –list-algos. The size of the commission will also be shown. This list will inform you if the program supports the algorithm / requires the personalization parameter (--pers), which is needed for some Equihash-based algorithms.   The second way to configure lolMiner is through the --coin (-c)  parameter. This option sets more detailed settings for the selected profiles and allows you to use special features such as algorithm switches or a combination of an algorithm with the correct personalization.   You can check the detailed list of additional parameters for lolMiner using the lolMiner -h command.

        "excerpt":"               All about SRBPolaris: How to use, How to start.          SRBPolaris is a program used to edit bios on AMD cards.   Download for Windows/Linux   You can download this utility at:   Download releases from GitHub   Download from BitcoinTalk    How to use SRBPolaris  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the program  \t\t \t\t \t\tOfficial sources for download only: GitHub and the forum of the author of the program - BitcoinTalk. \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure the program  \t\t \t\t \t\tOpen the BIOS file of your video card.          \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Start flashing Bios  \t \t \t \tYou have now successfully completely modified your Polaris graphics card and reduced the voltage. \t  \t \t  \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Program description   Such a program provides the ability to flash video cards, which guarantees you subsequently stable operation without interruptions and other problems.  This is necessary to increase the performance of a gpu in mining and not only.   Variety of cards are supported: from and to RX580.   The main features of SRBPolaris are:     unlocking the backup shaders;   Copy memory straps fast and easy   copying / editing time periods of work,   Memory timing strap editor - make your own custom straps   Unlock RX460 additional shaders   Set GPU voltage   Set default GPU and MEM clocks   Lot’s of useful stuff   This program is considered convenient, easy to use, and, importantly, it is more suitable for beginners or those who are busy with other things, and who has no time to delve deeply into something and study.   Acceleration of the video card is achieved by changing the initial settings in the BIOS of the video card, which are used by the operating system and application programs that are read during the initialization of the equipment immediately after turning on the computer.   The firmware of video cards for mining gives a significant increase in performance, for example, the flashed RX 570 gives out 30-40% higher speed when mining, in contrast to the non-flashed version. Bypassing the firmware of video cards, you will most likely need to improve the drivers of the operating system.   After flashing, it is extremely simple and convenient to monitor and control the characteristics of the video card using the GPU-Z and HWinfo programs, the main task of which is to demonstrate the voltage, frequencies, load on the video card and many other information that will be extremely useful.   Overclocking can be easily checked in HWinfo by monitoring video memory errors. With a large number of these errors, it is necessary to reduce overclocking by decreasing the operating frequency of the video memory or flashing less aggressive timings.   SRBPolaris Won’t Start?   The program requires .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)   Install it:        You will see the Windows Installer:        You need to wait about 5-10 minutes.

This file should be located in the same folder as the batch file itself.   ethash - we indicate the algorithm for mining.   ethash.poolbinance.com - we indicate the pool. This example uses Binance Pool. Read: How to Mine on the Binance Pool   8888 - we indicate the port from the pool. It can be found in the same place as the pool address.   username1 -  simply change username1 to your Binance account name.   This is how the Gminer batch file for eth will look like:   miner.exe --algo ethash --server ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 --user username1    NiceHash Gminer Config   For a NiceHash, the batch file will be like this:        And an explanation:           kawpow - specify the mining algorithm   kawpow.eu-west.nicehash.com - specify the server   3385 - we write the port   3LZhp4g3m7YWqR4hAPrZsKWbyo7hRBmqvy - and a wallet. Important! To mine for a nicehash, you need to specify the BTC wallet, and not the coin you are mining.
