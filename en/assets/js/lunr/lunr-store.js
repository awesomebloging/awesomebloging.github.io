You need to choose one of them to start mining.   The first option is --algo (-a) followed by one of the following algorithm names:                  BEAM-I       BeamHash I                 BEAM-II       BeamHash II                 BEAM-III       BeamHash III                 C29D       CuckarooD 29                 C29Z       CuckarooZ 29                 C30CTX       Cuckaroo 30 Cortex                 C31       Cuckatoo 31                 C32       Cuckatoo 32                 EQUI144_5       Equihash 144/5                 EQUI192_7       Equihash 192/7                 EQUI210_9       Equihash 210/9                 ZEL       ZelHash           Note that you can always find out the supported algorithms with the command: lolMiner –list-algos. The size of the commission will also be shown. This list will inform you if the program supports the algorithm / requires the personalization parameter (--pers), which is needed for some Equihash-based algorithms.   The second way to configure lolMiner is through the --coin (-c)  parameter. This option sets more detailed settings for the selected profiles and allows you to use special features such as algorithm switches or a combination of an algorithm with the correct personalization.   You can check the detailed list of additional parameters for lolMiner using the lolMiner -h command.

This is necessary to increase the performance of a gpu in mining and not only.   Variety of cards are supported: from and to RX580.   The main features of SRBPolaris are:     unlocking the backup shaders;   Copy memory straps fast and easy   copying / editing time periods of work,   Memory timing strap editor - make your own custom straps   Unlock RX460 additional shaders   Set GPU voltage   Set default GPU and MEM clocks   Lot’s of useful stuff   This program is considered convenient, easy to use, and, importantly, it is more suitable for beginners or those who are busy with other things, and who has no time to delve deeply into something and study.   Acceleration of the video card is achieved by changing the initial settings in the BIOS of the video card, which are used by the operating system and application programs that are read during the initialization of the equipment immediately after turning on the computer.   The firmware of video cards for mining gives a significant increase in performance, for example, the flashed RX 570 gives out 30-40% higher speed when mining, in contrast to the non-flashed version. Bypassing the firmware of video cards, you will most likely need to improve the drivers of the operating system.   After flashing, it is extremely simple and convenient to monitor and control the characteristics of the video card using the GPU-Z and HWinfo programs, the main task of which is to demonstrate the voltage, frequencies, load on the video card and many other information that will be extremely useful.   Overclocking can be easily checked in HWinfo by monitoring video memory errors. With a large number of these errors, it is necessary to reduce overclocking by decreasing the operating frequency of the video memory or flashing less aggressive timings.   SRBPolaris Won’t Start?   The program requires .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)   Install it:        You will see the Windows Installer:        You need to wait about 5-10 minutes.

This article describes how to get started mining with TeamRedMiner 0.8.3 and newer.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download releases from GitHub   Download releases from BitcoinTalk       TeamRedMiner review     TeamRedMiner is an AMD-exclusive mining software developed by programmers Todxx and Kerney666.     This software can mine cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ravencoin, Grin, Zcoin and others.     It is a command line program. This means that you run it from either the Windows command line or the Linux console, or you create shortcuts to predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or Windows command (.bat) file.      How to set up TeamRedMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t \t\t \t\tFirst, you need to download the software from this GitHub Release link. Make sure you select the correct file for your OS. If you have Linux, download the .tar.gz file, if you have Windows, download the .zip file. \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure a batch file for Ethereum  \t\t \t\t \t\tYou need to choose the correct config file (batch file) depending on the algorithm that you want to use for mining.

You can also change the mining URL, i.e. choose another pool. Then save as a batch file - .bat- if you are on Windows or as a bash file - .sh- if you are on Linux \t  \t \t  \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Team Red Miner Ethereum Setup      stratum stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org   PORT: 4444   Username: Wallet address   Password: Worker Password     To set up a batch file for ETH and etheremine pool, we need to enter 6 commands one by one:           teamredminer.exe - the name of the program to start. Please note that the batch file itself must be in the same folder as the program itself   -a ethash - after the key -a we indicate the algorithm for mining. In this example, Ether is therefore specifieded ethash   -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org - we indicate the address of the pool. This example uses ethermine.   :4444 - after the colon, we indicate the port of the pool. Ethermine has 4444.   -u 0x0c19EfE277b4e64f26c93b3a48A26EeD310421c8 - after that -u we write the address of our wallet to which mining will go.   .trmtest - we indicate the name of the worker after the dot. You can specify any. It is needed for the name of the farm, when you will be tracking statistics on the pool.   This is how the TeamRedMiner batch file for ETH on the ethermine pool will look:   teamredminer.exe -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x0c19EfE277b4e64f26c93b3a48A26EeD310421c8.trmtest -p x   NiceHash Config   Here is a batch file for NiceHesh:   teamredminer.exe -a kawpow -o stratum+tcp://kawpow.eu.nicehash.com:3385 -u 3LZhp4g3m7YWqR4hAPrZsKWbyo7hRBmqvy.trmtest -p x        This is an example for RVN:           kawpow - indicate the mining algorithm. In this case, Ravencoin   kawpow.eu-west.nicehash.com - specify the pool server for nicehash   3385 - we write the port from the pool   3LZhp4g3m7YWqR4hAPrZsKWbyo7hRBmqvy - and a wallet. Important! To mine for nice hash, you need to specify your BTC wallet, and not the coin you are mining.

In this guide, you will learn how to set up and use the T-Rex miner mining software to mine Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download releases from GitHub   Download from the website   Download releases from BitcoinTalk       T Rex Miner review     T-Rex Miner - is a multi-algorithm mining software optimized for NVIDIA graphics cards. This mining software can mine cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin and others.     Miner T-Rex is a command line program. This means that you run it either from the Windows command line, or from the Linux console, or create shortcuts to predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or a Windows batch file.      How to Install T-Rex Miner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t \t\t \t\tFirst, you need to download the software from this link. Make sure you select the correct file for your OS. If you are on Windows, download the .zip file. If on Linux, select the .tar.gz file. From the names of the files, you can see that these are versions of the program for different versions of the CUDA driver for your video card.  \t\t   If in doubt, download everything. \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure a batch file for Ethereum  \t\t \t\t \t\tOnce you download the program, you need to select the correct script file depending on the algorithm you want to use to mine cryptocurrency. Then edit the mining bat file and fill it with the wallet address, worker (farm) name and mining pool URL. Then save it as a .bat file if you are on Windows or bash - .sh if you are on Linux.  Here is an example T Rex Miner .bat file for the Binance Pool:  t-rex -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -u username1 -p x -w worker_name pause  \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Run T-Rex Miner  \t \t \t \t  Double click on the saved or finished start.bat file to start the miner.  \t  \t \t  \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Example T-Rex Miner for Binance Pool      STRATUM: ethproxy+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com   PORT: 8888   Username: username1   Password: x     This is how the ready-made T-Rex Miner bat file for ETH on the Binance Pool will look like        Just replace username1 with the name of your Binace pool account.   Example:   t-rex -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -u username1 -p x -w worker_name pause   If you want to understand how to set up everything from scratch, then you need to enter 5 commands one by one:           t-rex - the name of the program we run   ethash - algorithm for mining   ethash.poolbinance.com - pool address   8888 - pool port   username1 - username from the mining account on the exchange.   To set up a batch file for another coin - Firo (MTP), we need to enter other commands:   @echo off :start t-rex -a mtp -o stratum+ssl://zcoin.mintpond.com:3005 -u aMLjCeLBmBGEJP6dYtWEMdZZuPH4w6uFsK.rig0 -p x goto start pause   Here we added @echo off - it is used so that the extra text of the command itself is not displayed on the screen.

To set up a batch file for solo mining, we need to run the wallet in server mode with port 9999 and enter other commands:   cpuminer-sse2.exe -a scrypt -o http://127.0.0.1:9999 --coinbase-addr DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo  pause   Here we added --coinbase-addr  - used for solo mining.   You can try adding the rpc resolving IP to create .conf file To allow connections only from your local network, you can specify your subnet in the rpcconnect parameter. You also need to specify the internal IP address of the machine you are connecting the miner to in rpcconnect. Then start the wallet in server mode and use the wallet IP, rpcuser, rpcpassword and rpcport in the miner config file.

This post will show you how to get started mining with the latest version of PhoenixMiner.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download releases   Download from BitcoinTalk       What is PhoenixMiner     PhoenixMiner - is a Ethash (Dagger Hashimoto) cryptocurrency miner. First of all, these are Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Callisto and other popular coins. The program works with both AMD and Nvidia video cards. According to the developers, it is the fastest Ethereum / Ethash miner with the lowest fees.     How to set up PhoenixMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 -  Download the miner  \t\t \t\t \t\t Download PhoenixMiner, unzip it into a separate folder and find start.bat.  \t\t   \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Set up a batch file for Ethereum on Binance Pool  \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\tOpen the file start.bat with Notepad ++ or any suitable text editor and edit the file start.bat. You must change the pool login (word after -wal). replace username1  with your pool login, or if there is no registration on the pool, then insert after the -wal address of your wallet.  Here is an example of a Phoenix Miner .bat file for the Binance Pool:  \t\tPhoenixMiner.exe -pool ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -wal username1 -worker worker_name -epsw x -asm 2 -dbg -1 -allpools 1 -mode 1 pause  \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Run PhoenixMiner  \t \t \t \tSave this file and then double click start.bat to start mining. When the word “Accept” is displayed in the CMD window, it means that you have successfully submitted your solution to the pool. Further, mining statistics can be viewed on the pool. It will appear about 15 minutes after the start of mining. \t  \t \t  \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     PhoenixMiner example for Ethermine      STRATUM (pool address): eu1.ethermine.org   PORT: 4444   Username (-wal): 0xBB942274AB3C8285400519e7F0c343Fca2394908    Password: default     This is how the **PhoenixMiner batch file for ETH will look like on the Ethermine pool **           To set up a batch file for ETH, we need to enter 5 commands one by one into the .bat file:           PhoenixMiner - the name of the program we are launching.   eu1.ethermine.org - the address of the mining pool.   4444 - pool port.   0xBB942274AB3C8285400519e7F0c343Fca2394908 - the address of the wallet to which the mining is going.   This is how the finished Phoenix Miner batch file will look like:   PhoenixMiner.exe -pool eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -wal 0xBB942274AB3C8285400519e7F0c343Fca2394908   Pay attention to the syntax. In no case are extra spaces, symbols, line breaks allowed. If there are extra characters, then Phoenix Miner will not start.   PhoenixMiner setup for NiceHash   Here is a batch file for NiceHesh:   PhoenixMiner.exe -pool stratum+tcp://daggerhashimoto.eu.nicehash.com:3353 -wal 16p3MvQB7Va2cAPBahvkBePxqQtwTd77sP -pass x pause   Each example has a word at the end of the .bat file pause. This will help keep the CMD window always open. Even if you made a mistake in the syntax. In this case, the CMD console will display an inscription what the error is.   Monitoring and profit   After the miner sends several solutions (in about 10-15 minutes of work), you can check the status of work and profit on the “Income” page in your account on the exchange or on the pool that you have chosen.

If you have upgraded the Google Chrome browser to version 91, you may have noticed that some file downloads don’t work anymore in the browser.   But first, here’s a brief explanation of why this happens, assuming you know the file you’re trying to download is safe. Google Chrome and other web browsers will try and identify possibly malicious files. One minor flaw in this concept is that most web browsers often will flag unknown files as malicious. This is commonly known as heuristics, which is a fancy word for guessing.   But here comes a problem, files considered as unsafe by Chrome might however be “clean.” It can be frustrating when Chrome keeps blocking a download that you know it is from a trusted source.
