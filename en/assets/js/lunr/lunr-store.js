Download for Windows / Linux   Download releases from GitHub   Download from BitcoinTalk   Setting up   To set up a batch file, we need to enter three commands:           set \"POOL=eu1.ethermine.org:4444\" - specify the pool address   set \"WALLET=0x360d6f9efea21c82d341504366fd1c2eeea8fa9d.lolMinerWorker\" - specify the wallet address and farm name (any)   lolMiner.exe --algo ETHASH --pool !POOL! --user !WALLET! timeout 10 - we leave the standard command to run and the algorithm.

You need to choose one of them to start mining.   The first option is --algo (-a) followed by one of the following algorithm names:                  BEAM-I       BeamHash I                 BEAM-II       BeamHash II                 BEAM-III       BeamHash III                 C29D       CuckarooD 29                 C29Z       CuckarooZ 29                 C30CTX       Cuckaroo 30 Cortex                 C31       Cuckatoo 31                 C32       Cuckatoo 32                 EQUI144_5       Equihash 144/5                 EQUI192_7       Equihash 192/7                 EQUI210_9       Equihash 210/9                 ZEL       ZelHash           Note that you can always find out the supported algorithms with the command: lolMiner –list-algos. The size of the commission will also be shown. This list will inform you if the program supports the algorithm / requires the personalization parameter (--pers), which is needed for some Equihash-based algorithms.   The second way to configure lolMiner is through the --coin (-c)  parameter. This option sets more detailed settings for the selected profiles and allows you to use special features such as algorithm switches or a combination of an algorithm with the correct personalization.   You can check the detailed list of additional parameters for lolMiner using the lolMiner -h command.

Download for Windows/Linux   You can download this utility at:   Download releases from GitHub   Download from BitcoinTalk    How to use SRBPolaris  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the program  \t\t \t\t \t\tOfficial sources for download only: GitHub and the forum of the author of the program - BitcoinTalk. \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure the program  \t\t \t\t \t\tOpen the BIOS file of your video card.          \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Start flashing Bios  \t \t \t \tYou have now successfully completely modified your Polaris graphics card and reduced the voltage. \t  \t \t  \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Program description   Such a program provides the ability to flash video cards, which guarantees you subsequently stable operation without interruptions and other problems.  This is necessary to increase the performance of a gpu in mining and not only.   Variety of cards are supported: from and to RX580.   The main features of SRBPolaris are:     unlocking the backup shaders;   Copy memory straps fast and easy   copying / editing time periods of work,   Memory timing strap editor - make your own custom straps   Unlock RX460 additional shaders   Set GPU voltage   Set default GPU and MEM clocks   Lot’s of useful stuff   This program is considered convenient, easy to use, and, importantly, it is more suitable for beginners or those who are busy with other things, and who has no time to delve deeply into something and study.   Acceleration of the video card is achieved by changing the initial settings in the BIOS of the video card, which are used by the operating system and application programs that are read during the initialization of the equipment immediately after turning on the computer.   The firmware of video cards for mining gives a significant increase in performance, for example, the flashed RX 570 gives out 30-40% higher speed when mining, in contrast to the non-flashed version. Bypassing the firmware of video cards, you will most likely need to improve the drivers of the operating system.   After flashing, it is extremely simple and convenient to monitor and control the characteristics of the video card using the GPU-Z and HWinfo programs, the main task of which is to demonstrate the voltage, frequencies, load on the video card and many other information that will be extremely useful.   Overclocking can be easily checked in HWinfo by monitoring video memory errors. With a large number of these errors, it is necessary to reduce overclocking by decreasing the operating frequency of the video memory or flashing less aggressive timings.   SRBPolaris Won’t Start?   The program requires .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)   Install it:        You will see the Windows Installer:        You need to wait about 5-10 minutes.

This article describes how to get started mining with TeamRedMiner 0.8.0 and newer.   Download for Windows / Linux   Download releases from GitHub   Download releases from BitcoinTalk       TeamRedMiner review     TeamRedMiner is an AMD-exclusive mining software developed by programmers Todxx and Kerney666.     This software can mine cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ravencoin, Grin, Zcoin and others.     It is a command line program. This means that you run it from either the Windows command line or the Linux console, or you create shortcuts to predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or Windows command (.bat) file.      How to set up TeamRedMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t \t\t \t\tFirst, you need to download the software from this GitHub Release link. Make sure you select the correct file for your OS. If you have Linux, download the .tar.gz file, if you have Windows, download the .zip file. \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure a batch file for Ethereum  \t\t \t\t \t\tYou need to choose the correct config file (batch file) depending on the algorithm that you want to use for mining.

Please note that the batch file itself must be in the same folder as the program itself   -a ethash - after the key -a we indicate the algorithm for mining. In this example, Ether is therefore specifieded ethash   -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org - we indicate the address of the pool. This example uses ethermine.   :4444 - after the colon, we indicate the port of the pool. Ethermine has 4444.   -u 0x0c19EfE277b4e64f26c93b3a48A26EeD310421c8 - after that -u we write the address of our wallet to which mining will go.   .trmtest - we indicate the name of the worker after the dot. You can specify any. It is needed for the name of the farm, when you will be tracking statistics on the pool.   This is how the TeamRedMiner batch file for ETH on the ethermine pool will look:   teamredminer.exe -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x0c19EfE277b4e64f26c93b3a48A26EeD310421c8.trmtest -p x   NiceHash Config   Here is a batch file for NiceHesh:   teamredminer.exe -a kawpow -o stratum+tcp://kawpow.eu.nicehash.com:3385 -u 3LZhp4g3m7YWqR4hAPrZsKWbyo7hRBmqvy.trmtest -p x        This is an example for RVN:           kawpow - indicate the mining algorithm. In this case, Ravencoin   kawpow.eu-west.nicehash.com - specify the pool server for nicehash   3385 - we write the port from the pool   3LZhp4g3m7YWqR4hAPrZsKWbyo7hRBmqvy - and a wallet. Important! To mine for nice hash, you need to specify your BTC wallet, and not the coin you are mining.
