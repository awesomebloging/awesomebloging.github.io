In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up and use the PolarisBiosEditor.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download   Download releases       What is PolarisBiosEditor     PolarisBiosEditor - is a program for modifying timings and other useful characteristics of video cards running on the Polaris architecture. PolarisBiosEditor Pro is compatible with almost 99% of video cards with this architecture. PBE is suitable for RX4x0 and RX5x0 video adapters. Works with video cards with 2-8 GB and 16 GB memory.     Polaris Bios Editor PRO 3 2020 - is a paid version of Polaris Bios Editor. This version gives the largest increase in hash rate compared to the standard one, however, for 100% performance, you still need to manually adjust the memory clock frequencies and core voltages, the editor cannot predict the quality of the video card, so it is impossible to automatically use the maximum values.       How to use PolarisBiosEditor  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the program  \t\t \t\t \t\tFirst of all, go to the official website. Alternatively, download the archive from the official GitHub repository.  Extract the archive to any convenient folder. \t\t   \t\t  \t\t \t  \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Install the program  \t\t \t\t \t\tWe strongly recommend that you save the original BIOS in the GPU-Z program from the developers before you risk making changes. They can lead to unstable operation of the video card, and therefore it is vital to have the original configuration so that you can return everything to its original form.     Open the installer file PolarisBioseditor.exe. Click \"Open bios\". Find the BIOS file from the list that you saved thanks to GPU-Z.    On startup, the program displays a message from the developer. Click \"YES\" to continue.     After loading the BIOS, click «One Click Timing Patch».   The program applies the necessary timings for your GPU. Next, she will ask if you need to use it. Click OK.       We recommend that you test the new timings first. Take some time and watch the performance. If it is lower than expected, then reboot the BIOS. However, if you are asked about the timing again, refuse by pressing the \"NO\" button. Then a different timing will be applied.   After successfully applying the timings, you will see the following window:         \t\t \t\t \t   \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Save BIOS  \t \t \t \tAfter completing these procedures, you can save the modified BIOS file. However, save as a new document. Otherwise, the original BIOS will be overwritten. We recommend that you always have it in stock. It is better to save several files in reserve, distributing them in different folders.    \t  \t \t  \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Why can a video card be overclocked?   GPUs are always made with significant performance constraints. Developers of video cards in this way protect the entire batch from the occurrence of marriage. Thus, the factory sets the frequencies, as they say, “the average for the hospital.” However, in most cases, video cards are capable of operating at higher frequencies.   When it comes to mining or high-demand games, the question is what to use to make a GPU modification. There are also alternatives to the PolarisBiosEditor program.

Also, here you can exchange ERC-20 coins not only with ETH, but also with other cryptocurrencies.      Review     The creator of the MyCrypto wallet is Taylor Monahan, the founder of the popular cryptocurrency wallet MEW. At one time, he left the project, taking part of the team. In 2018, he released his own wallet, calling it a direct competitor to MyEtherWallet. In fact, it is a fork, and therefore the interface will be familiar to many. For the exchange of cryptocurrencies, a special service is involved here, implemented directly into the program. The application runs on a PC.           How to use  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download and Install  \t\t \t\tThe cryptocurrency wallet can be downloaded from the official website mycrypto.com.

It is a key store. To create it, you need to click on \"Generate a Keystore File\". After that, the system will ask you to enter a password.        It says here that you need to create the most difficult combination. In this case, there must be a different case (uppercase and lowercase letters), as well as a number. The harder you come up with a password, the better. However, we recommend that you write it down somewhere so as not to lose it. Then click on the \"Create New Wallet\" button.  Save your Keystore file    This stage is very important, and the system will inform you about it.   The file needs to be protected, as it stores the private key that gives access to your wallet.

To do this, you can use:      keystore file, private key or secret phrase.  The latter is also called a seed password or mnemonic phrase.    When choosing a file, the system will offer to load it from the media. To do this, connect the USB flash drive, open the file through the wallet and enter the password. Then click the \"unlock\" button.          The wallet will display all the wallet data.

If you want to use a digital coin that the crypto wallet does not yet know, then you need to register it yourself. This procedure will be somewhat more complicated.   To register a new ERC-20 cryptocurrency, you need to go to the Etherscan portal. In the search box, enter the name of the digital coin you want to add. The site contains all known tokens and data on them. It will return the result with the address of the contract. Your task is to copy the decimal places, the coin symbol, as well as the address itself. Go back to the wallet and go to the same section. Then click “Add your token”.   A window will appear for you where you need to specify the address, decimal places and the symbol of a digital coin, click “Save”. If everything is done correctly, then the cryptocurrency will be added to your wallet.   What are the reviews?   The wallet has received positive reviews in terms of reliability, not only for ease of use, but also for additional functionality. One of the options is transaction tracking. To do this, you need to insert a hash of the operation to check the status and how many confirmations the transaction has received.   It also has a built-in exchange service.
