<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After you find the IP address of the miner, you can start the device setup phase.</p>

<h2 id="firmware">Firmware</h2>

<p>WhatsMiner firmware can be updated with both WhatsMiner Tool (WMT) and SD card.</p>

<p>Before downloading and updating device software, be sure to check the type of control board (main board) of your device.</p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Warning!</strong> If there is a bug in the firmware, the update may fail or your control board may have problems that are extremely difficult to fix in some cases.</p>

<p>How to determine the type of miner control board:</p>

<p>To find out the type of board management through the WMT software or the miner device panel - enter the IP of the device in the browser. From the “Status” drop-down menu, enter the “OverView” section. This will display complete information about your device.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/tools/whatsminertool/control_board_type.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/tools/whatsminertool/control_board_type.webp" alt=" Overview" />
<figcaption>OverView tab and board control type.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>As you can see in the screenshot, the miner panel displays the phrase <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M21S.HB70.H3.</code> Here is what this phrase means:</p>

<p class="notice--ya">Asic M21s version 7.0 with H3 control board</p>

<p>If this phrase for your miner would look like this, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M21S.HB220.H6</code> then it would mean that:</p>

<p class="notice--ya">Asic M21s version 2.2 with H6 control board</p>

<p>Also, the version of the board is indicated in the WhatsMinerTool utility, in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Version Info</code> column.</p>

<p>If you want to update your miner, you must first <a href="https://microbt-whatsminer.com/firmwares-download/">download miner firmware update file from WhatsMiner website</a> and then refer to “WhatsMiner Tools” software. The firmware file has the extension <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bin</code>.</p>

<p>To update the firmware, first click the “Upgrade” button.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/tools/whatsminertool/en/upgrade.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/tools/whatsminertool/en/upgrade.webp" alt="upgrade" />
<figcaption>Upgrade tab for ASIC firmware.</figcaption></a></figure>

<ol>
  <li>At this stage, you must select the ip of the devices you want to update.</li>
  <li>Select the update file by pressing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Select File</code> button.</li>
  <li>Press the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Start Upgrade</code> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also click on the “Firmware Download Link” button in the utility to go to the official website for downloading firmware versions.</p>

<p>After selecting the update file, you do not need to do anything. You need to wait for the miner update process to complete. These steps take several minutes.</p>

<p class="notice--danger">Do not turn off the device during the firmware process, otherwise the miner may fail!
During the update, the device may reboot!</p>

<p class="notice--success">Once the upgrade process is complete, you can start <a href="/en/articles/mining/">mining</a> of your desired <a href="/en/articles/cryptocurrency/">digital currency</a> again.</p>

<p>In the line with the selected miner in the “Status” column, the progress of the operation will be displayed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transferring,</li>
  <li>Upgrading</li>
  <li>Success</li>
</ul>

<p>After a while, the status will change to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Running</code> (normal operation).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3 id="cant-see-asic">Can’t see ASIC</h3>

<p>Try the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Switch the Internet port on which the asic is from 100 megabits to 10.</li>
  <li>Try a different version of the app.</li>
  <li>Change your router.</li>
  <li>If you connect the device directly to a computer, the Internet Sharing service must be enabled. Then the ASIC will receive an IP address from the computer via DHCP.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also do the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check if the running computer is on the same network as the miners.</li>
  <li>Check the status with the alarm LED.
    <ul>
      <li>Network port signal: yellow always on, green flashing.</li>
      <li>Restart the miner and find the IP address again.</li>
      <li>Reset the miner (press the “RESET” button for 3 seconds until the red-green light flashes). Then find the IP address again.</li>
      <li>Replace the miner control board to determine if another control board is working.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Check if the router’s DHCP function is enabled.</li>
  <li>Allow the device to automatically obtain an IP.</li>
</ol>

<span itemprop="description">For example, when you get error code 540 on one device, it means that the SM0 hash board cannot work properly. You can do this: turn off the power, swap SM0 and SM2 hash boards, then reboot the miner to check if the board is really bad, if the error code has changed to 542, it means the hash board has a problem, if the error code is not changed, it means that the adapter plate has a problem.
The best result is that the error code is gone, this means only a connection problem.</span>

<p>Fing is a powerful network scanner with good functionality.</p>

<h3 id="web-version-in-browser">Web version in browser</h3>

<p>You can make settings in the web version directly in the browser.</p>

<p>For the initial setup, simply launch an Internet browser (for example, Chrome) and enter the IP address of the miner.</p>

<p>If you enter the address correctly, you will be shown a page similar to the one below and you will be prompted for a username and password. The username and password on Whatsminer devices is “root” by default.</p>

<p>First, enter the miner settings page and go to the “CGMiner” section from the “Configuration” tab.</p>

<p>In this step, enter information about the pool you want to connect to. To get information about a pool, you should visit the website of the desired pool.</p>

<h2 id="ssh">SSH</h2>

<p>To enable SSH, you need to enable Protection Mode in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Remote Ctrl</code> window.</p>

<p>In earlier versions of the utility there was an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enable SSH</code> setting. It is missing in the newer versions. The fact is that new ASIC models come with SSH disabled by default, so it is unlikely that you will get SSH access to them.</p>

<p class="notice--danger">When SSH is enabled, there is a security issue.</p>

<p>Most viruses and hacks happen over SSH, so most vendors have started disabling SSH in order to provide less support to their customers/victims of SSH hacks.</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are encrypted digital currencies that are created and stored electronically. They can be spent like regular money, but can also be used to buy and sell other digital currencies.</p>

<p>Virtual money has no material equivalent and is a record in a special <a href="/en/articles/blockchain/">database (blockchain)</a>. The base is very reliable, and the technology built on it, perhaps, gives humanity even more value than the coin itself.</p>

<figcaption>How do you explain cryptocurrency to a beginner?</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Simply put, cryptocurrency is digital money created from code using <a href="/en/articles/mining/">mining</a> farms or validators. The balances of the owners are stored in the ledger (register), which is distributed on many independent computers. This means that the blockchain registry does not belong to one person or organization, but exists as a complete copy on a large number of devices.</p>

<p class="notice--success">When a new transaction is made, it is verified by <strong>every</strong> <a href="/en/articles/blockchain/">computer in the blockchain network</a> and then validated. This makes any falsification almost impossible.</p>

<figcaption>Definition.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p><i class="fab fa-bitcoin"></i> <span class="bold">Is there a physical cryptocurrency?</span><br />
Think of cryptocurrency like owning a piece of land. You may not physically own it, but your ownership is recorded in the local government ledger. In the event of a dispute, you can enter your name on the ledger as the registered owner to prove that you bought and own the land.</p>

<p>Only in the case of digital assets, you do not need to confirm the ownership in the local government or in the bank.</p>

<div class="notice--success">
  <p><em>Main article: <strong><a href="/en/articles/blockchain/">How Blockchain Works in Cryptocurrency and Other Industries</a></strong></em></p>
</div>
<hr />

<p>Let’s take a look at how cryptocurrencies work. Digital currencies run on the blockchain. It makes transactions with virtual currencies especially secure. You can think of it as a log containing every cryptocurrency transaction. To protect against attacks, transaction data is distributed decentralized across multiple computers (nodes) that form a peer-to-peer network.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_how_works.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_how_works.webp" alt="How does cryptocurrency work" />
<figcaption>How it works.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Several transactions are combined into an encrypted data block. If it is full, it closes and can no longer be changed. Block by block, a chain is created that exists in the same way on all computers on the network. If someone tries to manipulate the chain on one of the computers, they will be blocked.</p>

<h3 id="mining-how-blocks-are-added-to-a-blockchain">Mining: how blocks are added to a blockchain</h3>

<div class="notice--success">
  <p><em>Main article: <strong><a href="/en/articles/mining/">How mining works</a></strong></em></p>
</div>
<hr />

<p>To process, secure and synchronize the growing number of transactions on the network requires huge computing power. If you lend your computing power to this “mining” process, you will be rewarded with coins. However, mining consumes a huge amount of electricity - as much as the Netherlands in a year.</p>

<p>New coins are generated in the process of mining, i.e., deciphering the tasks for issuing coins.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_mining.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_mining.webp" alt="Mining explained" />
<figcaption>Mining.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>In this way, coins are created by a network of participating users (miners). They are needed to decrypt cryptographic tasks for issuing tokens and coins.</p>

<p>Transactions in progress are checked for validity by thousands of computers on the network, verified and stored in a decentralized manner.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are designed to operate as independent, decentralized and cryptographically encrypted payment systems. The goal is to create better and more secure means of payment. Unlike official currencies, most cryptocurrencies are decentralized and usually limited in number. Some of them can also be used anonymously.</p>

<p class="notice--danger">In general, the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment is declining and banned in some countries.</p>

<p>Several companies accept payment with bitcoins. In most cases, online payment is accepted. Restaurants, cafes and shops are the exception rather than the rule. To be able to pay at the checkout, a corresponding QR code is usually required.</p>

<figcaption>Difference between coins and tokens.</figcaption></a></figure>

<h3 id="altcoins">Altcoins</h3>

<p>Contrary to what the name might suggest, altcoin is not one single cryptocurrency that bears that name. The “ALT” part of the word does not refer to any one new virtual currency such as “BIT” in Bitcoin. The word “alto” comes from the word “alternative”.</p>

<p class="notice--ya">Altcoin refers to all cryptocurrencies developed <em>after</em> bitcoin.</p>

<p>Thus, altcoin is an alternative to the first digital currency. For example, Ethereum is considered an altcoin.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_altcoins.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_altcoins.webp" alt="Altcoin Explained" />
<figcaption>What is an altcoin.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Cryptocurrency can be called an altcoin only if certain requirements are met, which BTC also has. This requirement is simply called: blockchain. Only cryptocurrencies that are also based on the same technology as Bitcoin can also be called an alternative to Bitcoin.</p>

<p>This point is important for distinguishing an altcoin from a cryptocurrency.</p>

<h3 id="promising">Promising</h3>

<p>In the years since the first bitcoin transaction in 2009, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">thousands of additional cryptocurrencies</a> have emerged, creating a confusing environment for investors. Some of these altcoins feature major technical innovations that set them apart from Bitcoin, while others have simply become popular digital currency brands and social media memes.</p>

<p class="notice--danger">Cryptocurrency investing remains highly speculative, but it can be highly lucrative for investors willing to take risks in the hope of big payouts.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="ethereum-eth">Ethereum (ETH)</h4>

<p>The next major digital currency after Bitcoin is Ether. On the Ethereum network, you can enter into smart contracts, that is, digital contracts that come into force after the contractual agreement is fully fulfilled.</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the market since 2015.</li>
  <li>Much more environmentally friendly due to the update <a href="/en/guide/merge/">Ethereum 2.0.</a></li>
  <li>Uses its own blockchain.</li>
  <li>Traded as the leading currency after bitcoin.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ripple-xrp">Ripple (XRP)</h4>

<p>Banks love this cryptocurrency because the payment network works with them and speeds up international bank transfers. Mining is not required - all coins have already been generated. There are 100 billion XRP in total.</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the market since 2012.</li>
  <li>Considered a classic bridge currency.</li>
  <li>Price fluctuations in the cent range.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="litecoin-ltc">Litecoin (LTC)</h4>

<p>Bitcoin’s little brother, the efficient Litecoin blockchain can generate more blocks and therefore process more transactions in less time.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_btc_altcoins.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_btc_altcoins.webp" alt="best altcoins" />
<figcaption>Promising and popular altcoins.</figcaption></a></figure>

<h4 id="iota">IOTA</h4>

<p>This network is designed for IoT applications <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-iot">(Internet of Things)</a> and allows transactions between machines or devices. In the future, you can use it, for example, to pay for charging an electric car or to protect e-health data. There are many large companies on the side of IOTA. Instead of a blockchain, there are nodes and a graph system. The project becomes faster and more secure with every connected user.</p>

<h4 id="cardano-ada">Cardano (ADA)</h4>

<p>The network wants to fix the first problems of other cryptocurrencies by combining their advantages. The project is easier to scale, conduct faster transactions and provide even greater security.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created in 2015 by the co-founder of Ethereum.</li>
  <li>More focus on sustainability and interoperability.</li>
  <li>Any scalability.</li>
  <li>Encryption.</li>
  <li>Considered a new generation of cryptocurrencies.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p class="notice--info">Sometimes you can hear that some altcoins are called tokens. In this case, the term is correct if the altcoin is built on the platform of another coin. For example, tokens <a href="/en/guide/usdt-works/">Tether (USDT)</a>, USD Coin (USDC) or SHIBA INU (SHIB) exist on the Ethereum platform.</p>

<h3 id="tokens">Tokens</h3>

<p>It is not easy for beginners to recognize the difference between cryptocurrencies and tokens. Tokens are digital assets that are embedded on <em>other</em> blockchains and do not have their own blockchain to run and operate. For example, many of the most popular tokens in the crypto space are built on the Ethereum blockchain and are often referred to as ERC-20 tokens.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_tokens_vs_coins.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_tokens_vs_coins.webp" alt="Crypto Coins vs Tokens" />
<figcaption>Differences between tokens and cryptocurrencies</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Tokens can represent an asset, such as digital art, or provide the holder with a specific service or application access.</p>

<p><strong>Nft tokens</strong></p>

<p>NFT (English non-fungible token - “non-fungible token”), also a unique token, is a digital entity that represents a specific physical or virtual object in the blockchain, which makes it unique. You can think of it as a painting by a famous artist. No matter how many copies or reprints there are, the original is always unique.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_nft.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_nft.webp" alt="what are Nft tokens" />
<figcaption>What are NFTs and how do they work.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>As digital proofs of authenticity, NFTs can display any virtual or real object on the blockchain.</p>

<p class="notice--primary">NFTs are best known for the hype surrounding digital art such as GIFs and memes. A reworked version of the popular cat cartoon “Nyan Cat” has been auctioned for the equivalent of around 500,000 euros.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="meme-coins">Meme coins</h3>

<p>Meme coins are cryptocurrencies based on a meme - an Internet joke that has become popular. It doesn’t have a purpose behind it like bitcoin wants to make the global financial system fairer.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> They were made for fun.</p>

<p>Memecoins are a group of cryptocurrencies that have no intrinsic utility or function, but simply act as a kind of <span class="yel">funny currency</span>. The first meme coin was Dogecoin, which started as a parody of Bitcoin. Many investors showed great interest in the fun currency, and over time, the price has risen significantly.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_meme_tokens.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_meme_tokens.webp" alt="What is coin meme" />
<figcaption>What is a Memes Tokens.</figcaption></a></figure>

<h3 id="stablecoins">Stablecoins</h3>

<p>A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the price of another asset, hence the term “stable”. For example, a dollar-pegged stablecoin should always be valued at 1 USD if it functions properly.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/en/guide/usdt-works/">Tether</a> is a classic example of a stablecoin. The rate remains always stable one to one to the dollar. The circulation is controlled by the company issuing it - Tether Limited and the Bitfinex exchange.</p>

<h2 id="comparison-with-fiat-money">Comparison with fiat money</h2>

<p>Fiat currencies, also “Cash” are traditional, paper money that everyone is used to. These currencies are only valuable because the regulators say so, and because the people who use them still believe in their value. Fiat money like dollars can be used to exchange for goods and services.</p>

<p>Let’s compare fiat currencies and digital ones.</p>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

<p>Cryptocurrencies, and even more so blockchain technology, can lead to improvements at a fundamental level with the approach to decentralization in various economic and social areas. As a result, entire sectors of the economy can be turned inside out in the long run. Traditional systems will no longer be needed.</p>

<p>The main advantages are the storage and transport of all information in a tamper-proof and fault-tolerant manner.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_potencial.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_potencial.webp" alt="cryptocurrencies Advantages" />
<figcaption>The Benefits of Digital Assets</figcaption></a></figure>

<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>

<p>In addition to the numerous advantages of cryptocurrencies, the risks cannot be neglected. Moreover, a beginner in the crypto world needs to carefully understand both the advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>The following theses are usually attributed to the disadvantages of cryptocurrencies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low liquidity compared to traditional financial instruments.</li>
  <li>Strong price fluctuations.</li>
  <li>Possible total loss of funds or data.</li>
  <li>Due to the lack of regulatory mechanisms, there are no guarantees for the safety of electronic crypto wallets.</li>
  <li>Loss of a password to an electronic crypto wallet or its inoperability leads to the irretrievable loss of all coins.</li>
</ul>

<p class="notice--danger">The developers of some digital assets are partially unknown and are engaged in deceiving users. You should be attentive to the crypto project, study it.</p>

<figcaption>Top 5 disadvantages of cryptocurrency</figcaption></a></figure>

<h2 id="risks">Risks</h2>

<p>A serious risk to consider is that billions of dollars worth of digital assets have been stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges over the past few years.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<figcaption>Risks</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Therefore, it is extremely important to beware of unlicensed platforms and only buy cryptocurrency from a regulated exchange or broker, of which there are not many. If you want to store your <a href="/en/wallets/">cryptocurrencies in your own wallet</a>, there are fewer risks.</p>

<p>It is possible to unequivocally answer the question: is cryptocurrency good or bad by summing up the advantages and risks.</p>

<p>Despite the disadvantages and risks, you should not hope for the collapse of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bitcoin, however, will not disappear because it is in fact decentralized and is still in high demand as a replacement for obsolete money by individuals, corporations and nation states.”
<sup>- Samson Mou, CEO, JAN3</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="law-bans-and-adoption">Law: bans and adoption</h2>

<p>Regulation in most countries, which is mostly just beginning, is a risk that should not be underestimated when investing.</p>

<p class="notice--danger">In addition to supporters, there are a number of opponents of cryptocurrencies. States like El Salvador feel their chance to become more independent of the dollar. Other states, such as China, are fiddling with their own digital money and have driven mining out of the country and banned trade.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>The amount of energy or computing power required for mining, including the required hardware, and the high energy consumption of each transaction is a thorn in the side of many government officials around the world.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_legal.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_legal.webp" alt="regulation of cryptocurrencies in countries" />
<figcaption>Countries that have banned or restricted the circulation of cryptocurrencies</figcaption></a></figure>

<p class="notice--success">On the other hand, there are supporters who see digital assets as a great opportunity for their country and are determined to follow this trend so as not to miss the stage of technological development, as was the case with the Internet and the so-called FANG shares. (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google).</p>

<p>Even among supporters, the picture is divided. Some see more regulation as a positive thing, as it will build confidence. The other side insists on decentralization and anonymity at all costs.</p>

<p>A general and worldwide ban is in doubt. Partial regulation is likely to have a negative impact on the whole situation, at least in the short term, but then may clear the way for institutional investors and thus pave the way for the very broad masses.</p>

<p>Therefore, a definitive declaration of a general ban is not possible.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-crypto-backed-by">What Is crypto Backed By?</h2>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are not backed by real assets or tangible securities. They are traded between the parties by agreement without a broker and tracked in digital ledgers.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> The rate is not backed by anything other than actual supply and demand.</p>

<p>At the same time, the cryptocurrency is provided by the value that the users of the Network give for it, reliability, limited emission and a number of other factors. According to many analysts, they have an even greater impact on the stability of the monetary system than gold and foreign exchange reserves.</p>

<h2 id="what-determines-price">What Determines Price?</h2>

<p>As a general rule, if the stock market crashes, then the cryptocurrency market crashes with it. There are also influencing factors, such as the legal regulation of cryptocurrencies, which is still largely open.</p>

<p class="notice--success">The reasons vary, but it’s still worth taking a look at <a href="https://bytwork.com/en/articles/btc-chart-history">Bitcoin’s price history since its inception and cycles</a> of the huge ups and downs that accompanied it.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/history_price_btc.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/history_price_btc.webp" alt=" all-time Bitcoin price chart" />
<figcaption>Bitcoin price history</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Sometimes there are sharp and unpredictable price fluctuations. It is impossible to say why the rates rise or fall. This represents a potential risk for investors. Due to the high volatility, investors are quicker to sell these high-risk investments.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-crypto-make-money">How does crypto make money?</h2>

<p>Cryptocurrencies allow you to earn money in various ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Trading speculation in cryptocurrencies or CFD contracts.</li>
  <li>“Reward” for doing various work on the network</li>
  <li>“Winning”</li>
  <li>Crypto lending and staking</li>
  <li>Investment</li>
  <li>Airdrops and forks</li>
  <li>Mining</li>
</ol>

<figcaption>Cryptocurrency earning options</figcaption></a></figure>

<h3 id="trading">Trading</h3>

<p>If you buy cryptocurrencies and the price rises, you can sell them and make a profit. It sounds very simple. However, for beginners it is important that theymore thoroughly dealt with cryptocurrencies. For example, not all digital currencies are equally suitable for trading and earning.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_trade.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/cryptocurrency/en/cryptocurrency_trade.webp" alt="Trading" />
<figcaption>Trading options</figcaption></a></figure>

<p><span class="bold">Contract Trading (CFD)</span></p>

<p>It is important to decide in advance whether you want to buy cryptocurrencies or want to trade CFDs without buying cryptocurrencies yourself.</p>

<p class="notice--ya">Contracts for difference (CFDs) are derivatives that allow you to bet on how the price will develop. CFDs exist on stocks and other real assets, as well as cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p class="notice--danger">Remember that CFDs are very risky. Depending on what price action the bet is on, whether the price goes down or up, you can make a mistake and lose.</p>

<h3 id="crypto-lending">Crypto lending</h3>

<p>Crypto lending offers the opportunity to earn interest by lending your cryptocurrencies. This can be done on peer-to-peer lending platforms, some crypto exchanges, and through so-called <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/defi/">DeFi, decentralized financial applications</a>, among others.</p>

<h3 id="investing">Investing</h3>

<p>Investing is a long-term strategy for buying and holding crypto assets for a long time. Cryptocurrency assets are usually well suited for a buy and hold strategy. They are extremely volatile in the short term but have huge upside potential in the long term.</p>

<h3 id="staking">Staking</h3>

<p>Simply put, <a href="/en/guide/eth-staking/">staking</a> is like a bank deposit with interest. The user transfers funds to the account, stores them and receives passive income for this. The more funds in the account, the higher the earnings. However, the more participants, the less income.</p>

<h3 id="mining">Mining</h3>

<p>Crypto coins are generated in a <a href="/en/articles/mining/">process called mining</a>. This process is complicated, but in simple terms, mining means that computers solve mathematical equations and receive bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies as a reward.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="airdrops-and-forks">Airdrops and forks</h3>

<p>An airdrop is a process by which a company distributes its tokens to the wallets of specific users, completely free of charge, in order to stimulate brand awareness.</p>

<p class="notice--success">Why would companies just give away their tokens? This is an effective way to get fast network usage and create hype around new blockchain based business. This acts as a way to reward investors and clients.</p>

<p>Some companies may use Airdrops for technological reasons, such as for a hard fork.</p>

<p>A hard fork occurs when changes are made to the code that create two paths for a project to develop. This is exactly what happened with Bitcoin Cash (BCH). After the fork, all BTC holders received BCH.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>To sum it up, it is important to do a thorough research, both in terms of the cryptocurrency you plan to add to your portfolio, and in terms of the exchange or broker you are opening an account with.</p>

<p class="notice--ya">Cryptocurrencies are not a form of investment with safe interest rates. Still, earning on cryptocurrency is possible. If you are willing to take on a high risk with this type of investment.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are an incredibly exciting trend that is no longer a dream of the future. Large profits are possible, but extensive knowledge of the financial market and investments is required.</p>

<p>Before diving into the crypto adventure, you should collect a lot of information, which is also described on the MiningSoft.org resource. Then you are more likely to celebrate successes rather than mourn losses.</p>

     Human-Centered Design: trust, simplicity at the Core
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p><em>There are a few things to keep in mind when designing for blockchain while keeping it simple.</em></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Blockchain. Even the mere name of it brings up mental pictures of mathematics, cryptography, and nodes, the digital currency that enables smooth, quick, and safe transactions.</p>

<p class="notice--success">But how does any of this relate to design? You must first understand the underlying ideas of blockchain in order to design for it. Here, we list the four main guidelines for blockchain design.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-blockchain">What is Blockchain?</h2>

<p>You must <a href="/en/articles/blockchain/">comprehend blockchain</a> in order to design for it. The existence of <a href="/en/articles/cryptocurrency">cryptocurrencies</a> like Bitcoin and Ethereum is made possible by blockchain technology.</p>

<p class="notice--info">It is fundamentally a distributed ledger where transactions are openly and chronologically recorded. Each transaction is then saved on a block of data that is difficult to tamper with after being cryptographically confirmed by network nodes.</p>

<p>Even though <a href="/en/articles/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum employ different forms of blockchain technology, they have several things in common. The decentralized nature of blockchain is the most striking comparison. It stores transaction information independently of any central authority.</p>

<p>A group of interconnected computers form the blockchain network, which receives copies of the blockchain and verifies transactions to preserve the integrity of the ledger.</p>

<p class="notice--ya">As a result, there can be no single point of failure, and the system cannot be altered or controlled by a single entity.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology is most often used by Crypto, which is presumably how you first heard of the term. However, the technology can be used for everything from financial transactions to keeping track of medical information and more.</p>

<p class="notice--primary">The name “blockchain” refers to a system where data is stored that cannot be altered.</p>

<p>The ability of blockchain technology to support decentralization is its other side, in addition to the fact that it makes cryptocurrencies possible.</p>

<p>Blockchain decentralization moves decision-making away from a centralized place or authority.</p>

<p class="notice--ya"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization">Decentralization</a> increases an organization’s efficiency and effectiveness by getting rid of pointless components, cutting down on duplication, and preventing single points of failure. Members of decentralized networks are meant to act independently without seeking approval from the centralized grid.</p>

<p>Three fundamental network structures—centralized, decentralized, and disseminated—are frequently employed when considering a technology setup.</p>

<p>Although decentralized networks are typically used by blockchain technology, a blockchain application may or may not be decentralized. Decentralization should therefore be implemented further up the grid and at both the technological and administrative levels.</p>

<p class="notice--warning">Therefore, it is crucial to keep design principles in mind when working on a product that supports decentralization.</p>

<h2 id="blockchain-design-principles-to-follow">Blockchain Design Principles to Follow</h2>

<p>Design and development of fintech apps has been gaining ground quickly. Here are the three blockchain design tenets that you ought to abide by. We’ve limited it to just three because designing for blockchain and cryptocurrency projects is more about understanding the technology, its intended audience, and the future blockchain brings than it is about adhering to the rules.</p>

<h3 id="human-centered-design">Human-Centered Design</h3>

<p>The most important aspect of blockchain is that users must have faith in it. Blockchain must be created in a way that is clear to all users in order to gain their trust.</p>

<p class="notice--success">Therefore, one of the most crucial aspects of blockchain design is how user-friendly it is. Giving people who may not be extremely tech-savvy basic, intuitive user interfaces is one method to do this. If you are looking for an example, <a href="https://cex.io/mobile">you can download bitcoin trading app for iPhone</a> made by CEX.iO</p>

<h3 id="designing-for-trust">Designing for Trust</h3>

<p>Designing for the blockchain entails planning to create a service or application that can be relied upon, is unchangeable, and is (nearly) completely transparent to all users and stakeholders.</p>

<p class="notice--danger">The fundamental function of blockchain is the handling of private data. Therefore, it’s crucial to keep the user’s trust when it comes to that information<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Reliability and stability of the platform are affected in some way by that trust. To preserve user confidence in your design and product, pay attention to customer feedback and maintain consistency.</p>

<h3 id="simplicity-at-the-core">Simplicity at the Core</h3>

<p>Make your application as simple and easy to use as possible. Blockchain creates an almost endless stream of data and information, so keeping your interface simple will make it easier for people. This also helps diminish entrance barriers to your platform. The less a user has to figure out, the easier it is to start using.</p>

<p>With that said, there are a few things to keep in mind when designing for blockchain while keeping it simple.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Security</strong> –Even with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/twofactor-authentication-2fa.asp">2FA</a>, users should have no trouble entering their login information (a secure password or biometrics). More importantly, every page, file, and transaction must encourage a sense of security while maintaining the design’s simplicity and navigability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, security shouldn’t be equated with resistance. You want a platform that makes every interaction feel safe and secure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Privacy</strong> –Some degree of privacy is necessary for sensitive information. Users desire privacy for their identities as well as for their activities on your platform. No matter what your product does, pseudonyms and private keys are two blockchain technology cornerstones that you should incorporate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Transparency</strong> –It takes time to complete a blockchain transaction, but we rarely know exactly how much of that time is related to network utilization. Users ought to know about their own transactions because the data is sensitive. Maintain your users informed when designing and keep transparency in mind.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="notice">For people to understand how your product functions and how it differs from those of your competitors, a transparent governance approach is also crucial.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistency</strong> – Establish one design language, and use it as much as you can. It enables consumers to move through your product with ease, pinpoint their location at any given moment, and decide what steps to do next. If the user interface of your blockchain project is clear, uncluttered, and adheres to a single design language throughout, it will be more successful.</li>
</ul>

     Roskomnadzor censorship on the example of bitcoin.

<p><em>In this article, you will learn about government blocking and how to solve this problem.</em></p>

<p>In August 2022, the largest website about cryptocurrencies, mining and blockchain - <a href="https://bytwork.com/en/">bytwork.com</a> was blocked by the Roskomnadzor (RKN), the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media.</p>

<p><strong>Legal</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basis for inclusion in the register of the information specified in paragraph 2 of this article is, among other things, a court decision that has entered into force on recognizing information disseminated via the Internet as information whose distribution is prohibited in the Russian Federation (paragraph 2 Part 5, Article 15.1 of Federal Law No. 149-FZ).<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In plain language, the basis for blocking was information about Bitcoin and its acquisition.</p>

<p><em>The essence of the blocking</em>: in 2020, the Onega City Court ruled to block the site bytwork.com without notifying the site administrators about the court, although there was such a possibility (the mail was indicated in the site footer).</p>

<p class="notice--warning">For 2 years (from 2020 to 2022), the matter went to Roskomnadzor, and only in August 2022 the department blocked the site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Received a notification from representatives of the department:</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/blog/rkn/uvedomlenie_rkn.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/blog/rkn/uvedomlenie_rkn.webp" alt=" notification" /></a></figure>

<p>The government notice proposes to remove material allegedly infringing the law. Otherwise, it will be included in the list of prohibited information.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-after-blocking">What to do after blocking?</h2>

<div class="imgcen">
<iframe class="your-ad-position-style" src="https://mat.cryptox-ads.io/cxAdsAssets/banner-basic-v0.11/index.html?size=300*250&amp;app_id=10905748&amp;placement_id=20003615" loading="lazy" style="border:0;width:300px; height:250px"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The Bytwork team initially tried to handle the whole process on their own. They removed the page because of which there was a court and notified representatives of the department about it.</p>

<p class="notice--danger">However, Roskomnadzor considered that the entire domain is subject to blocking. And despite the fact that the administrators of the Bytwork site removed the page against which the judgment was issued, <strong>RKN left the entire domain blocked</strong>.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/blog/rkn/rkn_block.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/blog/rkn/rkn_block.webp" alt="Roskomnadzor blocking" /><figcaption>Block type: entire domain, not article.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Next, Bytwork turned to lawyers. Not all lawyers understand how to conduct such cases, moreover, many did not understand what blocking from the RKN is and who blocks access to sites in Russia?</p>

<p>The Bytwork team realized that it was necessary to look for lawyers specializing in such cases!</p>

<p>According to numerous reviews and advice from administrators and owners of other sites-colleagues, the company DRC.law was found.</p>

<p><a href="https://drc.law/">DRC.law</a> is a large company of IT lawyers. They solve all legal issues for users, website owners, IT and Telecom businesses!</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/blog/rkn/drc.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/blog/rkn/drc.webp" alt=" DRC.law" /></a></figure>

<p>Contacting <a href="https://drc.law/">DRC.law</a>, Bytwork immediately outlined the issue. The lawyers instantly, thanks to their vast experience in handling such cases, described a possible solution to the blocking problem, drew up an action plan and honestly set the deadlines (let’s say right away that DRC.law did everything quickly and efficiently, all the deadlines depended only on the Court, post offices and other related to this).</p>

<p>After listening to the action plan, the Bytwork team decided to cooperate with DRC.law.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>The DRC.law team immediately proceeded to create an appeal based on the fact that Bytwork was not notified of the trial and the procedural deadlines were violated.</p>

<p>It should be noted right away that DRC.law gives you a choice of 2 options for working with them:<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<ol>
  <li>You personally go to court with lawyers;</li>
  <li>You draw up a power of attorney for the company (it is only for the court), and the lawyer himself goes to court on your behalf. Bytwork chose option 2!</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the court was very far away, it was easier and more profitable to issue a power of attorney.</p>

<p>After the appeal was drawn up, it was sent to court (everything was done very quickly). The appeal was sent in <strong>August 2022</strong>! And the answer from the Onega City Court came already <strong>October 10, 2022</strong>.</p>

<p>Note that the letter came to the Bytwork team at the specified home address and in parallel to the legal address drc.law.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/blog/rkn/appelyacia.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/blog/rkn/appelyacia.webp" alt=" Appeal to Roskomnadzor" /><figcaption>Notice that the state has accepted the appeal.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p class="notice--primary">Further, only <strong>November 1, 2022</strong> the case goes to court!</p>

<p>The appeal was considered for about 2 months, after which the date of the new hearing was set for <strong>12/21/2022</strong>!</p>

<h3 id="second-hearing">Second hearing?</h3>

<p>On December 1, 2022, right before the new year, the Bytwork team gets a great message from the lawyers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hello! The lawyer wrote that the decision of the Onega city court was canceled in the part of the bytwork website and the case was sent for a new trial to the court of first instance. Next, we are waiting for the case to be sent to the court of first instance and the appointment of a court session.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AND:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“An important point, at this stage, after receiving the appealsionic determination, we can submit a request to the RKN and the site will be unblocked “</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything is great, and we are very grateful to drc.law for the work done, but the matter is still not fully resolved, because:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“However, the case is not closed, because the issue of blocking depends on the second session of the first instance”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the new hearing will take place on February 3, 2023!</p>

<p class="notice--ya">But until that moment, lawyers from <a href="https://drc.law/">DRC.law</a> wrote a letter to the RKN to unblock the site (since the case in which we were blocked by the RKN no longer existed). And thanks to their letter to Roskomnadzor on January 23, bytwork.com was already unblocked!</p>

<h3 id="victory">Victory!</h3>

<p>On February 3, 2023, the Bytwork team receives the following letter from attorneys:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hello! I have great news: during the meeting after the break, the prosecutor announced that he was dropping his claim regarding the requirements for bytwork. The refusal was accepted by the court, the proceedings were terminated. So everything ended well.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s all! The Bytwork team won the case thanks to the lawyers from drc.law! They advised and accompanied Bytwork throughout the case!</p>

<p>Huge thanks to:</p>

<p>Inna Tverezovskaya.</p>

<p><em>A Simple Guide for the Newest of Beginners.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-is-blockchain">What is blockchain?</h2>

<p>Blockchain is a database that is not centrally located in one place, but distributed across many computers. The most important task of a blockchain is to securely document digital transactions. The technology has become famous thanks to cryptocurrencies such as <a href="/en/articles/bitcoin">bitcoin</a> and ethereum.</p>

<p>Simply put, a blockchain is a decentralized or distributed database (also: distributed ledger). This means that it does not reside with one person or organization, but exists as a complete copy on a large number of computers.</p>

<figcaption>What is blockchain in simple words.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Blockchain was created as a cash book for the virtual currency Bitcoin, in which all users should be able to view all transactions. This technology is now being used for other cryptocurrencies as well.</p>

  <dt>bitcoin</dt>
  <dd>Digital money designed for decentralized payments, that is, transactions without intermediaries such as banks.</dd>

  <dd>Bitcoin is also called a cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin payment system uses cryptographic methods to store the information it contains.</dd>
  <dt>Mining</dt>
  <dd>The process of mining cryptocurrency using the power of computers. They solve complex tasks by validating the blockchain network. At the same time, a new block of bitcoins is found, for which <a href="/en/articles/mining">miners</a> receive a reward.</dd>
</dl>

<p>As the name suggests, a blockchain is a <span class="yel">aggregation of blocks</span> of data. The easiest way to illustrate this approach is with an example. To do this, we use the Bitcoin cryptocurrency:</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/blockchain/en/block.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/blockchain/en/block.webp" alt="Blocks in blockchain" />
<figcaption>Blocks in the blockchain.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Simply put, a block of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum can be compared to an Excel spreadsheet that has the following structure:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>User A (sender)</th>
      <th>User B (recipient)</th>
      <th>transaction amount</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>bc1ql2qw7ujlpn27hat32nklptsyytff30ys8wpj96</td>
      <td>bc1qhs3gptkxem5y7yaq2yg0un2m8hae6wt87gkx4n</td>
      <td>0.0518814 BTC</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>bc1qrpp7g75sx3ejclvsfdw2uahzchtyu7vumkuadu</td>
      <td>bc1q4s0vsp6gpc2aqt0cvd703hxy5jv93d76mra2mf</td>
      <td>0.0002813 BTC</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The contents of the first two columns are the anonymous addresses (hash) of the sender and recipient of the corresponding transaction. With each transaction, the table (block) is supplemented with the next row. When a certain number of lines (size) is reached, the block is closed, sealed and filed. Then the next block starts.</p>

<p>Over time, numerous blocks are created that line up: the blockchain. The more blocks in the blockchain network, the higher the security. These blocks are created by miners.</p>

<figcaption>Explanation of blocks of blockchain technology.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>The big difference between a regular database and a blockchain is decentralized storage. The technology works with a network of computers and servers that store each individual block in parallel.</p>

<p>Let’s explain using <a href="/en/articles/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> as an example. Think of blockchain as a ledger. Users of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency initiate transactions by buying, selling or paying with currency. As with an account, these movements must be recorded so that others can understand the transactions.</p>

<p>As a result, no one loses sight of how much Bitcoin has been bought and sold. Therefore, the computers involved create a block for transactions containing all the necessary information. The block is attached to the blockchain - the registry, expanding it. Computers encrypt the block using a complex algorithm.</p>

  <li>All computers participating in the network now calculate the encryption algorithm.</li>
  <li>After the algorithm is generated, the computers coordinate and add the encrypted block to the block chain.</li>
  <li>All computers participating in the network keep the same block.</li>

<h2 id="application-implementation-in-business">Application, implementation in business</h2>

<p>Blockchain technology is the modern and best form of doing business. It removes layers of “bureaucracy” and friction.
Blockchain also eliminates the need for businesses that provide services related to checking and certifying goods, guarantees, and registering/recording a transaction in a public registry.</p>

<p>This means that all related jobs (accountants, sales representatives, lawyers, and other office administration workers) and businesses that have traditionally served these needs are a thing of the past.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Blockchain can be applied to the following business areas:</p>

  <li>Retail</li>
  <li>Transport</li>
  <li>Logistics</li>
  <li>Management</li>
  <li>Finance</li>
  <li>Services</li>

  <li>Sports</li>
  <li>Real estate</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="which-business-will-kill-blockchain">Which business will kill blockchain</h3>

<p>Blockchain is needed where the speed and reliability of data transfer is important - that is, in almost all areas of life: when concluding smart contracts for the supply of goods, buying and registering real estate, logistics. This technology enhances the trust, security, transparency, and traceability of data exchanged across a business network.</p>

<h4 id="banking-and-payments">Banking and payments</h4>

<p>One of the most famous use cases of blockchain is financial transactions. First of all, cryptocurrencies illustrate how this technology can be used in the financial world.</p>

<section class="imp">
  <p><span class="par"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> <span class="yel bold">How is blockchain better than traditional banks?</span><br />
It uses encryption. This is done using the <a href="/en/articles/mining/#calculating-hashes">hash function</a> and protects data from hacking and manipulation.</span></p>
</section>

<p>In the process of using the blockchain, individual transactions are verified and distributed among the so-called nodes (miners, validators, network participants). This results in a high level of data consistency and a particularly high degree of transparency. These properties are the basis for banking operations.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/blockchain/en/blockchain_transaction.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/blockchain/en/blockchain_transaction.webp" alt="Transactions" />
<figcaption>Transactions on the blockchain.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>This principle opens up interesting applications for international payments. Since verification takes place internally, intermediaries can be eliminated and transaction costs can be reduced. The absence of intermediaries also ensures faster transaction speeds.</p>

<h4 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h4>

<p>The healthcare sector is also showing that blockchain can definitely offer benefits. It can be configured so that only selected users have access to stored data (assets).</p>

<p>In particular, personal documents such as patient records, medical reports, and disease progression can be stored on the blockchain. Access to this data is provided only to selected users who were previously recognized as the owner of the data.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/blockchain/en/blockchain_healthcare.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/blockchain/en/blockchain_healthcare.webp" alt="Blockchain healthcare use case." />
<figcaption>Blockchain healthcare use case.</figcaption></a></figure>

<h4 id="identity-and-personal-data-management">Identity and personal data management</h4>

<p>Identification is a complex task in some business areas. However, with the help of blockchain technology, people’s identities can be identified more safely and quickly than before.</p>

<p>This is based on extensive databases that allow identification and verification. In particular, existing identity documents — driver’s licenses, passports, and ID cards — can be securely implemented digitally. Manipulation would also be virtually impossible.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/blockchain/en/blockchain_identity.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/blockchain/en/blockchain_identity.webp" alt="Identity management" />
<figcaption>Identity management</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Data leakage will also be prevented as the data is stored in a decentralized manner.</p>

<h4 id="insurance">Insurance</h4>

<p>Modern blockchains offer the possibility of developing smart contracts. These are intelligent computer scripts that automatically initiate transactions on the blockchain.</p>
<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/blockchain/en/blockchain_smart_contracts.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/blockchain/en/blockchain_smart_contracts.webp" alt="Smart contracts on the blockchain." />
<figcaption>Smart contracts on the blockchain.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>The results are predetermined in the contract and depend on the actions of the parties involved in the smart contract. When both parties fulfill their obligations, the smart contract will know what action to take next. <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For insurance companies, smart contracts offer great added value because, above all, the processing of claims for damages or insurance payments can be displayed automatically and securely.</p>

<h4 id="supply-chain">Supply chain</h4>

<p>Logistics advantages can be obtained by creating simpler contracts and constantly tracking the relevant goods.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/blockchain/en/blockchain_supplay.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/blockchain/en/blockchain_supplay.webp" alt="Supply chains on the blockchain." />
<figcaption>blockchain in supply chain example.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Thus, the food supply chain will be completely transparently documented from the point of origin to the final supermarket. This is where the advantage of distributed data processing offered by blockchain becomes apparent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, blockchain could be used to track the movement of goods throughout the supply chain, from the point of origin to the point of sale. This would allow all stakeholders to see where the goods are at any given time and make sure that they are being handled properly. Additionally, blockchain could be used to verify the authenticity of goods, ensuring that only certified, safe products are being sold.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="manufacturing">Manufacturing</h4>

<p>The option of distribution of access rights also plays a key role in manufacturing. In addition, the technology can document the ownership of an item and is suitable for use in this area.</p>

<figcaption>How is blockchain changing manufacturing?</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>With distributed ledger technology, it will be possible to use the vehicle/equipment when needed and pay directly for the service used.</p>

<h4 id="energy">Energy</h4>

<p>The energy market is also undergoing constant changes. Blockchain technology is preparing to increase the transparency of this market by making transactions traceable.</p>

<p class="notice--ya">For example, the billing of private solar systems can be optimized in this way. Such positive regulation could accelerate the announced energy transition.</p>

<p>Within the framework of electromobility, billing for electronic charging stations can also be implemented in this way and the actual payment process can be ensured.</p>

<h4 id="voting-system">Voting system</h4>

<p>Blockchain technology can also be used in online elections. The base system will be considered a neutral space. Voters could take part in elections without fear of manipulation.</p>

<figcaption>Blockchain voting system.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>In this way, each voter can also keep track of their vote and check if it was counted correctly. Faking or changing the voice is also not possible.</p>

<h4 id="certification">Certification</h4>

<p>Educational qualifications such as references or certificates are the backbone of professional life and some people rely on fakes to get certified by a well-known specialized institution.</p>

<p class="notice--ya">Using the blockchain, institutions, universities and technical colleges are able to issue diplomas and certificates that cannot be counterfeited. They will be protected by a private key and recognized internationally.</p>

<p>Thus, official certification and sending of original documents will be excluded.</p>

<h2 id="scalability">Scalability</h2>

<p>One of the key challenges facing Bitcoin is scalability<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, the ability of the network to handle increasing numbers of transactions as more people adopt the technology.</p>

<p>Over the next 10 years, it’s likely that the Bitcoin network will need to continue to evolve and adapt to handle the growing demand.</p>

<p class="notice--success">One potential solution is the implementation of the Lightning Network, a second layer payment protocol that enables fast and inexpensive transactions without overwhelming the main Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>If this and other scalability solutions are successfully implemented, it could go a long way in paving the way for wider adoption and growth of Bitcoin.</p>

<h2 id="regulation">Regulation</h2>

<div class="imgcen">
<iframe class="your-ad-position-style" src="https://mat.cryptox-ads.io/cxAdsAssets/banner-basic-v0.11/index.html?size=300*250&amp;app_id=10905748&amp;placement_id=20003615" loading="lazy" style="border:0;width:300px; height:250px"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Another factor that could significantly impact the future of Bitcoin is regulation<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p class="notice--danger">In recent years, regulators around the world have begun to take a closer look at cryptocurrencies and many countries have introduced new laws and regulations to govern their use.</p>

<p>While some argue that too much regulation could stifle innovation and limit the potential of cryptocurrencies, others believe that sensible regulation will help to protect consumers and prevent criminal activity.</p>

<p>The next 10 years are likely to see continued debate over the best way to regulate cryptocurrencies, and the outcome of this debate will have a significant impact on the future of Bitcoin.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/pic/btc_2.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/pic/btc_2.webp" alt="btc img" /></a></figure>

<h2 id="institutional-adoption">Institutional Adoption</h2>

<p>In recent years, we’ve already seen a significant increase in institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. From investment banks and hedge funds to pension funds and endowments, more and more traditional financial players are starting to allocate resources to cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p class="notice--info">This trend is likely to continue in the next 10 years, as institutional investors become more comfortable with the asset class and seek to diversify their portfolios.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The entry of institutional investors into the market could help to bring greater stability and credibility to the cryptocurrency market and increase demand for Bitcoin.</p>

<h2 id="technological-developments">Technological Developments</h2>

<p>The world of technology is constantly evolving, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. Over the next 10 years, we can expect to see continued innovation and development in the cryptocurrency space, including the emergence of new technologies and use cases.</p>

<p class="notice--ya">For example, the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is already having a major impact on the cryptocurrency market and this trend is likely to continue.</p>

<p>As technology continues to advance, it could open up new opportunities for Bitcoin and help to drive its growth and adoption.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/pic/btc_3.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/pic/btc_3.webp" alt="btc img" /></a></figure>

<h2 id="competition">Competition</h2>

<p>Although Bitcoin is currently the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency, it’s far from the only one.</p>

<p class="notice--primary">Over the next 10 years, we can expect to see continued competition from other cryptocurrencies, including new entrants and established players.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Some of these competitors may offer faster, cheaper or more secure alternatives to Bitcoin, and could potentially challenge its dominance. However, Bitcoin has a significant head start and a strong network effect, which could give it a competitive advantage in the years to come.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The future of Bitcoin is uncertain, but there are several key factors that will influence its trajectory in the coming years, including scalability, regulation, institutional adoption, and technological developments.</p>

<p>The next 10 years are likely to be a period of growth and evolution for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>While it’s impossible to predict exactly what the future holds, Bitcoin has already come a long way since its creation in 2009 and has the potential to continue playing a significant role in the financial world.</p>

<p class="notice--success">It’s important to do your research and understand the risks and potential rewards before investing in Bitcoin. You should also read through <a href="https://coinwire.com/price-predictions/">articles on price prediction</a> to equip yourself with the necessary knowledge.</p>

<p>With a calculated risk, Bitcoin can offer growth potential and a unique opportunity to participate in the emerging world of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The world of cryptocurrencies is rapidly evolving, making it worth keeping an eye on for those who are seasoned or just starting out in investing. The right approach could lead to growth and wealth creation in the future.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mining">What is mining?</h2>

<p>New <a href="/en/articles/bitcoin">bitcoins</a> are generated in a process called mining. This process is complicated, but in simple terms, mining is when computers solve mathematical equations, and as a reward they receive bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The term “mining” means “digging”, i.e. creation of new coins. This is done by the so-called miners, who, in the case of bitcoins, add the next block to the blockchain and collect a reward for this. <a href="/en/articles/blockchain/">Blockchain is a ledger</a> that keeps track of how many bitcoins someone has and who transfers them to where.</p>

<figcaption>Mining definition.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p class="notice--warning">The idea for the name of the process of creating new cryptocoins arose from a comparison with gold miners looking for gold in mines.</p>

<p>In English, the term “mining” refers more to the extraction and extraction of valuable metals in mines and tunnels.</p>

<p>Comparing cryptocurrency mining with gold mining, the name becomes clear. In both forms of mining, miners perform work and are rewarded in the form of an uncirculated asset. Along with digital gold, natural gold is also mined from the ground and becomes part of the economy.</p>

</div>

<p>When using cryptocurrency, transaction details are recorded in the so-called blockchain (registry). The miner is tasked with solving the complex problem behind this transaction. The process ends when the miner confirms the legitimacy of the transaction. Once this is done, the transaction will be visible to everyone on the blockchain.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/what_is_mining.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/what_is_mining.webp" alt="How mining works" />
<figcaption>How mining works.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Simply put, it is about solving complex mathematical problems. Therefore, the transaction verification process requires miners to use high processing power.</p>

<p>The more miners involved in the verification process, the faster the transaction is confirmed. For conducting such a transaction, the miners receive a part of the transaction as a commission. Each successful transaction generates additional new coins that are put into circulation on the blockchain network.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-calculated">What is calculated?</h2>

<p>Mining farms are engaged in the calculation of “hashes” according to a given algorithm for cryptocurrency. These hashes are mathematically calculated sequences of letters and numbers stored in blocks.</p>

<p class="notice--ya">The most famous cryptographic hash functions used in cryptocurrency algorithms include “SHA-256” in Bitcoin, “Ethash” in Ethereum Classic, “Scrypt” in Litecoin.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/how_mining.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/how_mining.webp" alt="Mining process" />
<figcaption>Mining process.</figcaption></a></figure>

<h3 id="calculating-hashes">Calculating hashes</h3>

<p>A Bitcoin block contains hashes, which store the hashes of previous blocks, as well as transaction details.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>hash</dt>
  <dd>A hash in the Bitcoin blockchain is a fixed length of a unique sequence of random numbers containing data of any size. Each hash is unique, so you can’t look at a hash and guess what data it contains.</dd>
</dl>

<p>To understand the complex nature of a hash, consider an analogy: every Bitcoin hash is like asking someone to flip a coin 160 times and write it either heads or tails. In the case of heads or tails, there are only two variables on the coin. However, with numbers and letters, the possibilities of a 160-character Bitcoin hash are endless. There will never be two identical values.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/mining_hash.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/mining_hash.webp" alt="What is a hash" />
<figcaption>What is a hash.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>In a hash puzzle, the resulting fingerprint is a list of characters (let’s call it a word), for example, “cat”, after which your task is to find the desired “fingerprint” of this word. To do this, all you can do is try all possible combinations of numbers (of a certain length), one by one.</p>

<h3 id="hashrate-and-hashing">Hashrate and hashing</h3>

<p>To summarize the information above, a hash is a randomly generated alphanumeric code, and hashing is the process of guessing that code. Hashrate here is the speed of mining, hashing (solving the puzzle).</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/hashing.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/hashing.webp" alt="Hashing" />
<figcaption>Hashing is a method of generating a fixed size output from a variable size input.</figcaption></a></figure>

<dl>
  <dt>Hashing</dt>
  <dd>transformation and generation of input data of any length into a fixed-size string, which is performed according to a certain algorithm. Specifically, the Bitcoin hashing algorithm is SHA-256 or 256-bit Secure Hashing Algorithm.</dd>
  <dt>Hashrate</dt>
  <dd>A measure of the processing power per second used in mining. Simply put, this is the speed of mining. It is measured in hash units per second, which means how many calculations can be performed per second. Machines with high hashing power are very efficient and can process a large amount of data per second.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="notice--warning">Here it becomes obvious that the more powerful our hashing machine (aka mining farm), the faster we will find a solution to the algorithm and get income.</p>

<p>But powerful devices will immediately find all Bitcoins, right? No, there is a complexity parameter in the algorithm for this.</p>

<h3 id="network-complexity">Network complexity</h3>

<p>Mining difficulty is how difficult it is to find a given hash below the <span class="yel">target value</span>.</p>

<p>The target value is recalculated every 2016 blocks, with the mining difficulty being inversely proportional to the <span class="yel">target value</span>.</p>

<p>As mining difficulty increases, the <span class="yel">target value</span> decreases, and vice versa.</p>

<p class="notice--ya">In simple terms, for beginners, it is about solving complex mathematical problems. Therefore, the transaction verification process requires miners to use high processing power.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/difficulty.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/difficulty.webp" alt="Network complexity" />
<figcaption>Network complexity</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>As mining speed increases, mining difficulty also increases. As a result, the speed of block creation is reduced to the desired 10 minutes, as mentioned earlier. All this is described in the Proof of Work<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> algorithm.</p>

<p>Once the mining difficulty increases, the average mining time returns to normal and the cycle repeats approximately every 2 weeks.</p>

<h2 id="equipment-and-requirements">Equipment and Requirements</h2>

<p>Mining uses the processing power of a video card (for some cryptocurrencies, a processor) to mine coins such as Monero or Ethereum Classic.</p>

<p>There are also ASICs specially designed devices, such as Bitmain and Antminer.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/asic.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/asic.webp" alt="asics for mining." />
<figcaption>An ASIC chip is 1000 times more efficient at mining than a chip in a home PC.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Cryptocurrency mining requires a special GPU (Graphic Processor Unit) designed to solve complex equations inlittle time. If you want to start crypto mining without your own hardware, so-called cloud mining farms are available.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-better-asic-or-mining-farm">What is better ASIC or mining farm</h3>

<p>Initially, the creators of Bitcoin planned to mine it on the central processing units (CPUs) of widely used laptops or desktop computers. However, ASICs have outperformed both processors and graphics cards (GPUs) due to their lower power consumption and higher processing power.</p>

<p class="notice--ya">Thus, ASICs are better than processors and video cards in mining. They are more powerful in terms of processing power. They can process much more data per unit of time.</p>

<p>Ultimately, more and more miners with high computing power will be more successful than smaller home miners.</p>

<figcaption>Device performance table.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>The performance hierarchy is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU - The central processing unit of the computer. The lowest efficiency.</li>
  <li>GPU - Graphics processor (video card). Average efficiency.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA - Integrated Circuit</a>. High performance.</li>

<h3 id="mining-methods">Mining methods</h3>

<p>There are different approaches to cryptocurrency mining. Here are the 4 most popular types, ranked by the degree of simplicity.</p>

<section class="imp">
  <p><span class="par"><i class="fas fa-mug-hot"></i> <span class="bold">Mining methods:</span> <br /></span>
<span class="par"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> <b class="yel">Cloud mining</b>. As the cost of acquiring GPU or ASIC miners is getting higher compared to revenues, cloud mining farms are becoming more and more popular. Cloud mining allows individual miners to take advantage of large corporations and specialized facilities. With a cloud solution, you can rent cloud hardware for a specific period of time. <br /></span>
<span class="par"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> <b class="yel">CPU mining</b>. In the early days of technology, CPU mining was the easiest way to start mining. To start cryptomining, a simple home PC with a good processor was enough. However, mining on processors is too slow and does not bring that much profit, if you take into account the costs of electricity and cooling. <br /></span>
<span class="par"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> <b class="yel">GPU mining</b>. Several GPUs, so-called video cards, are combined into a large mining farm, which increases the processing power used. <br /></span>
<span class="par"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> <b class="yel">ASIC mining</b>. Unlike GPU miners, ASIC miners are specifically designed for cryptocurrency mining, so they can produce more units of cryptocurrency than GPUs. However, the acquisition costs of such ASIC miners are many times higher than those of GPU or CPU miners. <br /></span></p>

<p>ASIC farms are used for bitcoin mining.</p>

<p>What cryptocurrency is being mined?
All coins with the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/en/view/pow/">proof of work algorithm</a> can be mined on farms. And mining rig<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> is part of the farm.</p>

<h2 id="mining-is-not-profitable">Mining is not profitable?</h2>

<p>It is said from time to time that mining is dead. There are several factors at work here. Even if the miners are profitable, you must consider upfront costs such as hardware purchases and ongoing electricity costs. Only when all the costs are calculated can one see if it is profitable.</p>

<p>The benefit also depends on the type of equipment. For example, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service, a hash rate of 14 terahashes per second can be obtained either from a single ASIC miner with a power of only 1800 watts, or from more than half a million 40 megawatt Sony game consoles.</p>

<h3 id="halvings-and-rewards">Halvings and rewards</h3>

<p>Bitcoin rewards are halved every four years. This is a process known as halving<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Therefore, miners must become more efficient and faster in order to maintain a constant profit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When Bitcoin was first released in 2009, a miner was earning 50 BTC per block.</li>
  <li>By 2012, the reward was 25 BTC per block.</li>
  <li>After Bitcoin halved in 2016, the reward was halved again to 12.5 coins.</li>
  <li>The reward is currently 6.25 BTC per block.</li>
  <li>The next halving is expected at the end of May 2024. Then the block reward for miners will be halved to 3.125 BTC.</li>
</ul>

<p class="notice--info">In the protocols of many cryptocoins, a halving formula has been introduced. This is important to take into account when calculating.</p>

<h2 id="power-consumption">Power consumption</h2>

<p>You can use various <a href="https://whattomine.com/">online profitability calculators</a> to decide if mining is profitable for you based on electricity cost, device efficiency, mining time and currency value.</p>

<p>According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the energy demand of the global Bitcoin network is about 90 terawatt-hours. This currently corresponds to about 0.4 percent of the world’s electricity.</p>

<p>By comparison, air conditioning systems in the US alone last consumed about 2,199 terawatt-hours. This is more than 24 times the energy requirement for global bitcoin mining.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/energy.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/mining/en/energy.webp" alt="Bitcoin electricity consumption." />
<figcaption>Bitcoin electricity consumption</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>The BBC estimated Bitcoin’s electricity consumption to be higher than in Argentina (121 TWh), the Netherlands (108.8 TWh) and the United Arab Emirates (113.20 TWh) and is gradually approaching Norway (122.20 TWh). ).<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p class="notice--success">Proponents, on the other hand, see more benefit in mining: they argue that mining can protect the power grid from fluctuations or failures. To maintain the power grid, a certain voltage must always be maintained.</p>

<p>Yes, the energy demand for bitcoin mining is high and will continue to rise as the number of miners increases. But network security will also grow.</p>

<p>According to the Bitcoin Mining Council<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, almost 60 percent of the energy needed for global Bitcoin mining already comes from natural sources such as wind or solar energy: this share currently stands at 58.9 percent.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-when-mining-ends">What happens when mining ends?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The maximum supply of Bitcoin is rigidly defined and will never exceed the limit of almost 21 million coins<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. Thus, the supply of BTC cannot be expanded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the halving, the last bitcoin won’t be mined until around 2140. According to the analytical company Coinmarketcap<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>, there are currently just over 19 million coins in circulation. This means that it will take miners at least 117 years to mine the remaining two million coins - that is, for the remaining ten percent.</p>

<h2 id="law">Law</h2>

<p>Crypto mining itself is completely legal, but some crypto miners use malware to obtain cryptocurrencies in an illegal way.</p>

<p>This scam is called cryptojacking. These are programs used to covertly search for digital currency on hacked computers.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, that is, neither a central bank, nor a central database, nor a single central authority manages the monetary network. Cryptocurrencies do not have a central authority. Rather, they are run by the cryptocurrency community and, in particular, by cryptocurrency miners.</p>

<p><em>In this article, you will learn everything about BTC. Let’s explain how virtual money works?</em></p>

<h2 id="what-is-bitcoin">What is bitcoin?</h2>

<p>Bitcoin is a digital and global monetary system, a cryptocurrency. It allows people to send or receive money over the Internet, even from people they don’t know or trust. This is the first technology of its kind that allows the transfer of a digital asset over the Internet without the intervention of a third party.</p>

<p class="notice--ya">Digital money can be exchanged without being tied to a real person. The mathematical field of cryptography is the backbone of Bitcoin security.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is an electronic currency that exists only in the virtual space of the Internet. Also often used is the abbreviation BTC, which is the monetary unit in the Bitcoin system, for which there is a limited supply of 21 million coins<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/bitcoin/en/what-is-bitcoin.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/bitcoin/en/what-is-bitcoin.webp" alt="What is Bitcoin" />
<figcaption>Bitcoin is a type of digital currency known as a cryptocurrency.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Bitcoin is the oldest and leading cryptocurrency in the world. The term bitcoin consists of the English words “bit” (digital unit) and “coin” (coin) and means a digital coin. Unlike traditional currencies, BTC does not depend on states and banks.</p>

<p>At first glance, it seems that BTC is different from ordinary money, but in fact there are many similarities. It’s just that bitcoin is more modern and functional than debit cards.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that uses blockchain technology to ensure its security.</p>

<h2 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h2>

<p>Physically, there is no cryptocurrency, there are only special registries that track how many bitcoins someone has and who transfers them to where. These registries are called blockchains.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/bitcoin/en/blockchain-works.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/bitcoin/en/blockchain-works.webp" alt="Blockchain technology" />
<figcaption>How the blockchain works.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>All purchases, sales and payments in cryptocurrency are stored in blocks of data linked to each other in a chain. This is the blockchain (see terms above). There is a network of people who use their computers to make sure everything is done right. These are miners.</p>

<p class="notice--warning">For their work, miners receive new bitcoins. Each participant has a copy of the blockchain stored on their computer. Therefore, fakes are almost impossible.</p>

<p>Blockchain is a complex database, like a giant ledger of individual blocks of information. The trick is that information is shared and stored in a chain of interconnected blocks. This ensures its security and prevents unauthorized access.</p>

<p class="notice--info">The information recorded on the blockchain remains there forever. Nobody can change her.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not the only thing that uses blockchain technology – many other cryptocurrencies use it as well. And various companies use the underlying technology for non-cryptocurrency purposes.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The inventor of BTC is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym of an unknown software developer or development team). In view of the global economic crisis of 2007, he wanted to provide the world community with an independent transaction system that was cryptographically secure, verifiable and immutable.</p>

<p class="notice--ya">The concept and open source software were published between 2008 and 2009 by an individual or group of individuals under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It is still not clear who is behind this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is certain, however, is that Nakamoto released the first version of the Bitcoin Core reference implementation in 2009, thereby laying the foundation for Bitcoin, which was the first cryptocurrency in history.</p>

<p class="notice--warning">The first goods paid for with Bitcoin were two pizzas in 2010 that cost 10,000 BTC. 10 years later, Bitcoin owners could buy a mega yacht or a private jet for the same amount.</p>

<h3 id="historical-price--events">Historical Price &amp; Events</h3>

<p>In 2009, the exchange rate of one Bitcoin was about one dollar. In November 2021, the value of the cryptocurrency exceeded $69,000, which is a record high.</p>

<p>The value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed in recent years. Only in the last five years, the cost has increased by about a hundred times.</p>

<p class="notice--success">Anyone who bought BTC with €100 in 2009 is now a multimillionaire. It awakens desires.</p>

<p>Recently, institutional investors and international corporations are increasingly investing part of their assets in Bitcoin. This led to a further increase in prices. But no one can say if this will continue.</p>

<p>The value of digital assets is subject to sharp fluctuations. Therefore, the savings you urgently need should never be invested in digital assets because the price risk is huge. BTC is not a safe investment.</p>

<p class="notice--success">In practice, BTC is in the so-called wallet on a PC or mobile phone. They are protected by a very long password. Storing cryptocurrencies on your own device is called “cold storage”. This is the most secure storage method.</p>

<p class="notice--danger">Online platforms or <a href="https://bytwork.com/en/markets">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> also offer wallets linked to a user account. These are so-called “hot wallets”, which can be accessed using a computer or smartphone. This is the least secure storage method because the exchange can be hacked.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-bitcoin-look-like">What does bitcoin look like?</h2>

<p>Bitcoin has no coins or banknotes. Cryptocurrency exists only virtually, like a string of digital characters in a computer program.</p>

<figure><a href="/assets/images/articles/bitcoin/en/btc_look.webp" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/bitcoin/en/btc_look.webp" alt="What Bitcoin looks like" />
<figcaption>What Bitcoin looks like.</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Virtual currency is fundamentally different from currencies such as the euro or the dollar. Behind the latter are economic powers and central banks that provide security and stability. Bitcoin does not have this, which ensures that it is not tracked or protected.</p>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Cryptocurrencies are available worldwide and operate independently of states.</li>
  <li>Blockchain technology is considered very secure.</li>
  <li>The basis is a decentralized database, a blockchain stored on several computers and managed jointly by the participants. All transactions are protected from forgery using cryptographic methods.</li>
  <li>Unlike classic money, the new coins are notare issued and not controlled by a central authority such as a central bank, but are created and managed decentralized through cryptographic computing on the network.</li>
  <li>Unlike classical currencies such as dollars or euros, an unlimited amount of BTC cannot be created. There is a limit of 21 million. Most of the coins have already been created.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/assets/images/articles/bitcoin/btc_1.jpg" class="image-popup"> <img src="/assets/images/articles/bitcoin/btc_1.jpg" alt="cryptocurrency" /> </a></p>

<p>In addition, the internet currency is considered to be inflation resistant as its absolute amount is capped at 21 million.
This was also the goal of the inventor Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym for an unknown software developer or software development team).</p>

<p>In view of the global economic crisis of 2007, the creator wanted to provide the world community with an independent transaction system that would be cryptographically secure, verifiable and immutable.</p>

<h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>

<p>Payment transactions are carried out and protected using the blockchain. This means that other participants in the Bitcoin network are of central importance. Many other computers on the network participate in the payment transaction, making the encryption very secure from manipulation. For providing computing power, the rest of the participants again receive bitcoins - this is how new bitcoins are created.</p>

<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>

<h3 id="volatility">Volatility</h3>

<p>The price of bitcoin is considered unstable, volatile<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This means that it is subject to strong fluctuations.</p>

<p>The price of bitcoin fluctuates much more than stock prices. In November 2021, one bitcoin was worth $69,000, in May 2022 it dropped to $27,000. This is a difference of more than 50 percent.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a digital currency, there is no real value behind it, as, for example, is the case with gold. In addition, BTC is not a national currency.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="shadow-market">Shadow market</h3>

<p>Critics believe that criminogenic elements use bitcoin to trade drugs or weapons. Hackers blackmail companies by shutting down computer systems and demanding a ransom in bitcoin. You can buy bitcoins anonymously. This is why digital currency has always been so popular among criminals.</p>

<p class="notice--primary">However, following this logic, cash is also used to trade in drugs or weapons. This does not mean that cash should be banned.</p>

<h3 id="high-risks">High risks</h3>

<p>Bitcoin has a reputation for being a non-transparent object of speculation, rather than a convenient, independent, and widespread means of payment. Some people have become very rich because of this - in fiat money like euros and dollars - others have lost a lot of money.</p>

<p>If law abiding citizens want to use Bitcoin, this is not possible anonymously due to government regulations, and a normal bank account is usually required, so Bitcoin is not independent of banks and governments.</p>

<h3 id="other-disadvantages">Other disadvantages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>As a result of hacker attacks on large crypto platforms, amounts of several million euros have disappeared.</li>
  <li>Cryptographic verification of transactions in the blockchain and the creation of new coins require gigantic power consumption.</li>
  <li>It is estimated that the global bitcoin network consumes as much electricity as Sweden in 2022.</li>
  <li>If you lose the private key to your virtual wallet, then digital money will be lost.</li>
  <li>Future hacker attacks cannot be completely ruled out.</li>
  <li>There are no contracts and legal guarantees.</li>
  <li>If the Internet collapsed, then the digital currency could no longer be used.</li>

<p>Many Linux users are familiar with the concept of a default route. This is a route that your computer automatically uses when it needs to send traffic to a specific destination. But what about when you need to use a different route for specific domains? In this article, we will show you how to create custom routes for specific domains in Linux.</p>

<p>Some systems prefer certain routes to be used for communications between different parts of the operating system. For example, on a Unix-based system, the default route might be used to send traffic destined for the network interface card (NIC) to the appropriate kernel module.</p>

<p class="notice--warning">Knowing which route is being used can help troubleshoot problems.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-right-route-for-a-specific-domain-in-linux">How To Choose The Right Route For A Specific Domain In Linux?</h2>

<p>When choosing a route for a specific domain in Linux, it is important to consider the traffic patterns and requirements of your network. There are several different routes that can be chosen depending on the needs of your network. The following are four different routes that can be adopted when routing traffic in Linux:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Static Route</strong>: A static route is defined once and never changes. This is the most common route type used in Linux because it is easy to set up and does not require any configuration on routers or firewalls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dynamic Route</strong>: A dynamic route is created each time a packet is routed through the system. This type of route can be more complicated to set up, but it offers greater flexibility because it can update automatically based on changes in the network.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To display the current routing table in Linux, run the command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># ip route</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">default via 192.168.1.1 dev enp0s3</code> – default gateway, in this example, working through interface <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enp0s3</code>. If there is no route for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">target</code> address in the routing table, then such a packet is sent through this gateway (default route)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.0/24 dev enp0s3 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.201</code> - static route for the network <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.0/24</code> through the address <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.201</code>, which is registered on the interface</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proto kernel</code> - route created by kernel ( proto static - route added by administrator)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">metric</code> – route priority (the lower the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">metric</code> value, the higher the priority). If there are two routes with the same metric (don’t do that!), the kernel starts randomly selecting routes.
To find out through which interface (gateway) traffic should be routed to a specific IP address, use the command:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># ip route get 192.168.2.45</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="how-to-find-the-best-dns-route-for-your-web-server-in-linux">How To Find The Best Dns Route For Your Web Server In Linux?</h2>

<p>In this article, we’ll show you how to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">route</code> command to find the best DNS route for your web server.</p>

<p class="notice--success">A routed command is a powerful tool that can be used to manipulate network traffic in Linux.</p>

<p>By using the route command, you can determine which packets should be forwarded through your server based on their destination addresses. This can be helpful if you need to configure your server in a specific way, such as routing all traffic for a specific domain through your web server.</p>

<p>To use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">route</code> command, you first need to know which domain name you want to route traffic for. You can find this information by querying your DNS provider or by looking at your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/hosts</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="which-linux-route-is-right-for-your-site">Which Linux Route Is Right For Your Site?</h2>
<p>Linux offers a variety of ways to route traffic to specific sites. This can be useful when you need to control how users access certain parts of your site, or when you want to manage traffic load on specific sections of your site.</p>

<p>There are three main ways Linux routes traffic:</p>

<ol>
  <li>via a direct route,</li>
  <li>via an indirect route,</li>
  <li>and through a proxy server.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Direct routing</strong> is the simplest type of routing, and it uses the IP address of the destination site as the source address for outgoing packets.</p>

<p>This approach is best suited for sites that require a consistent level of security and reliability.</p>

<p><strong>Indirect routing</strong> involves sending packets through one or more intermediate hosts before they reach their destination.</p>

<p>This approach can improve performance because it reduces the number of hops required to reach the destination site. However, indirect routing can also introduce vulnerabilities if the intermediate hosts are compromised.</p>

<h2 id="system-administrator-trying-to-optimize-linux-traffic-to-save-bandwidth">System Administrator Trying To Optimize Linux Traffic To Save Bandwidth?</h2>

<p>Linux is a powerful operating system that can be used to optimize traffic on a network. It’s possible to route traffic for specific domains through a Linux server in order to save bandwidth.</p>

<p>This type of optimization can be useful if you have a lot of traffic coming from one domain and want to redirect it through your server.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-check-if-a-website-is-running-on-linux">How To Check If A Website Is Running On Linux?</h2>

<p>Running a website on Linux can be a great option for those who are looking to save money on hosting costs, or who want to run their site without relying on the third-party domain name and hostname of your website.</p>

<p>If you are using a custom domain name, you can use the route command to reach <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Queervices</code>. However, in order to ensure that your website is running on Linux, it is important to check your DNS server for the hostname of your site.</p>

<p>If you are using a hosted domain name, you can contact your hosting provider to find out the hostname of your site. Additionally, you can use a web browser extension like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WhoIsHostingThis</code> to determine the hostname of your site.</p>

<h2 id="final-words">Final Words</h2>

<p>It is important to know which route for a specific domain will be the most efficient for your needs. There are many options open to you, so it is important to do your research to find the best option for your needs.</p>]]></content><author><name>Matthew Wood</name></author><category term="guide" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to create custom routes for specific domains in Linux.

<p>ETHPoW is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain created after the transition of <a href="/en/guide/eth-staking/">Ethereum to staking</a>.</p>

<p><dfn>EthereumPoW</dfn> (abbreviated ETHW) is a token launched as part of the EthereumPoW program, the purpose of which is to preserve the version of <a href="/en/guide/merge/">Merge-mined Ethereum</a>. The release date of the coin is September 15, 2022. You can get a 1:1 airdrop with ETH lying on the same address with ETHW.</p>

<h2 id="system-requirements">System requirements</h2>

<p>The system requirements for mining are the same as for Ethereum:</p>

<ul class="notice--primary">
  <li>Mining equipment: GPU (NVIDIA or AMD, video memory at least 6 GB) or several ASICs.</li>
  <li>Operating system: Windows, Linux.</li>
  <li>Virtual memory: set 6 GB of virtual memory for one video card (for example, set 36 GB for 6 video cards).</li>
  <li>Mining software: <a href="/en/miners/phoenixminer/">PhoenixMiner</a>, <a href="/en/miners/lolminer/">lolMiner</a>, <a href="/en/miners/nbminer/">NBMiner</a>, <a href="/en/miners/gminer/">GMiner</a>, <a href="/en/miners/trexminer/">T-rex Miner</a> etc.</li>

<p>You can get a wallet either at <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> or on the exchange. Consider both options.</p>
<p>You need to register on the exchange using <a href="https://cutt.ly/b8fRKBL">registration form</a>. Fill out the form with your email address and a secure password.</p>
